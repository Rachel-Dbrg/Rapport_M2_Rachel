  abstract = {The main goal of this research was to investigate the differences in diet composition among three species of the genus Lutjanus inhabiting a coastal lagoon as juveniles. The working hypothesis was that these species feed on a common base of food resources and therefore, some niche overlap is present in terms of general diet composition. However, changes in the trophic niche with size and differences in some morphological traits among species explain observed differences in diet. Fish were collected during 42 sampling trips conducted regularly from February 2011 to January 2012 using several types of fishing gear. Total number of analyzed stomachs was 288 for Lutjanus argentiventris from 2.3 to 19.9 cm total length (TL); 178 for Lutjanus colorado ranging from 2.4 to 30.1 cm TL; and 183 for Lutjanus novemfasciatus with 1.2 to 20.0 cm TL. Results indicate that juveniles of all three lutjanid species share a general diet based on decapods and fishes. However, L. novemfasciatus has a more piscivorous habit, which can be explained by a more slender body shape and larger teeth, characteristics, which increase fish catching performance. Larger fish of all three species eat larger prey, which is consistent with the optimum foraging theory.},

  abstract = {This paper presents various imputation methods for air quality data specifically in Malaysia. The main objective was to select the best method of imputation and to compare whether there was any difference in the methods used between stations in Peninsular Malaysia. Missing data for various cases are randomly simulated with 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30\% missing. Six methods used in this paper were mean and median substitution, expectation-maximization (EM) method, singular value decomposition (SVD), K-nearest neighbour (KNN) method and sequential K-nearest neighbour (SKNN) method. The performance of the imputations is compared using the performance indicator: The correlation coefficient (R), the index of agreement (d) and the mean absolute error (MAE). Based on the result obtained, it can be concluded that EM, KNN and SKNN are the three best methods. The same result are obtained for all the eight monitoring station used in this study.

  abstract = {The spatio-temporal distribution of cross-shelf exchanges in the northern Bay of Biscay from 2007 to 2010 were investigated using a high-resolution three-dimensional model as well as sea-surface temperature and chlorophyll-a concentration satellite observations. Our results show that the net yearly mean transport was upslope each year, with 2010 showing the highest value (0.93 Sv upslope). Bottom fluxes showed peak values near Chapel Bank, with mean values of 0.1 m3 s-1 m-2 and maximum values of 0.2 m3 s-1 m-2. Our model demonstrated that cross-shelf exchanges can be divided into three vertical layers. At the surface, cross-shelf transports are driven by wind forcing (Ekman transport accounts for about 60\% of the total cross-shelf transport) and mesoscale activity (eddy advection accounts for about 30\% of transport). In the absence of mesoscale activity, Ekman transport at the surface is typically balanced out by a downslope flux at the bottom boundary layer. Exchanges at mid-depths are regulated by mesoscale activity and tides. A ubiquitous feature appeared at the bottom boundary with a cross-shelf flow in the downslope direction. Numerical simulations suggest bottom fluxes of 0.1 m3 s-1 m-2, in agreement with previous in situ observations. We discuss the impact of winds, tides and mesoscale eddies on cross-shelf exchanges using different examples. The eddy census was obtained using an eddy-tracking algorithm. The shelf break was shown to be an important area of eddy presence due to slope current instabilities. The impact of eddies on surface and mid-depth transport is illustrated with a shelf-break eddy as an example, from its generation to dissipation and its contribution to cross-shelf exchanges. Results suggest that the largest magnitudes of downslope transports occur in the presence of both strong winds and intense eddy activity. Our detailed and quantitative exploration of cross-shelf transports in the northern Bay of Biscay highlights the relative contribution of intermittent processes (e.g. wind-driven events, eddies, frictional bottom layer) and confirms the complex links between the coastal and open ocean over shelf breaks.},

The exhaustive sampling of prey items captured by each species remains, however, a demanding task. Therefore, predicting diets from other variables, such as functional traits, may be a valuable method. Here, we attempted to predict trophic guild and diet overlap for 35 fish species using 13 ecomorphological traits related to feeding ecology. We compared linear discriminant analysis and random forest (RF) classifiers in their ability to predict trophic guild. We used generalized dissimilarity modelling to predict diet overlap from functional distances between species pairs. All models were evaluated using the same cross-validation procedure. We found that fish trophic guilds were accurately predicted by an RF classifier, even with a limited number of traits, when no more than 7 guilds were defined. Prediction was no longer accurate when finer trophic guilds were created (8 or more guilds), whatever the combination of traits. Furthermore, predicting the degree of diet dissimilarity between species pairs, based on their ecomorphological traits dissimilarities, was profoundly unreliable (at least 76\% of unexplained variation). These results suggest that we can predict fish trophic guilds accurately from ecomorphological traits, but not diet overlap and resource partitioning because of inherent versatility in fish diets. More generally, our statistical framework may be applied to any kind of marine organism for which feeding strategies need to be determined from traits.},

Results indicated significant differences in the functional traits between species providing a low functional niche overlap. Although, the ecological and biological information of fishes were scarce, we demonstrated that functional analyses are effective to extrapolate the prey preferences, sizes and detection and propulsion efficiencies for their feeding and swimming strategies. Our study supports the hypothesis that in some environments with a limitation of resources, species coexisting is due to high resource partitioning. The present work is a first attempt to compare the morpho-functional characteristics and niche partitioning in the deep-sea fish assemblages from the Indian waters.},

  abstract = {The deep ocean is by far the planet's largest biome and holds a wealth of potential natural assets. Human exploitation of the deep ocean is rapidly increasing whilst becoming more visible to many through the popular media, particularly film and television. The scientific literature of deep-sea exploitation and its effects has also rapidly expanded as a direct function of this increased national and global interest in exploitation of deep-sea resources, both biological (e.g. fisheries, genetic resources) and non-biological (e.g. minerals, oil, gas, methane hydrate). At the same time there is a growing interest in deep-sea contamination (including plastics), with many such studies featured in high profile scientific journals and covered by global media outlets. However, there is currently no comprehensive integration of this information in any form and these topics are only superficially covered in classic textbooks on deep-sea biology. This concise and accessible work provides an understanding of the relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, both at the seafloor and in the water column, and how these might be affected as a result of human interaction, exploitation and, ultimately, environmental change. It follows a logical progression from geological and physical processes, ecology, biology, and biogeography, to exploitation, management, and conservation. Natural Capital and Exploitation of the Deep Ocean is aimed at marine biologists and ecologists, oceanographers, fisheries scientists and managers, fish biologists, environmental scientists, and conservation biologists. It will also be of relevance and use to a multi-disciplinary audience of fish and wildlife agencies, NGOs, and government departments involved in deep-sea conservation and management.},

Their use has received a growing interest in marine community ecology, for both fundamental and applied purposes. The need of ecological indicators as part of marine directives and conservation programmes has promoted the use of multiple traits for indicator development, but in a questionable context regarding the state of fundamental developments. Biological Trait Analysis (BTA) is a complex research field, characterised by flexible concepts and applications. In order to enhance the development of relevant marine ecological indicators, this review provides baselines for better theoretical and applied BTA. A compilation of the existing literature reveals that specific topics have dominated the use of multiple traits in marine ecology unlike in freshwater and terrestrial ecology where tests of theories and uses of evolutionary concepts consistently preceded BTA applications. Availability of data sets and analytical techniques seemed to have driven the growing use of marine BTA rather than fundamental questions regarding life history theories in marine ecosystem components and the functional nature of traits. It is therefore suggested that greater focus on life history ecology and on the links between marine species traits and ecosystem functioning are still needed to support trait-based indicator development. Life history strategy understanding is put forward as a theoretically-sound basis and fundamental pre-requisite for trait-based marine indicator development.},

Maps of benthic communities' distribution exist, but there is little knowledge on canyon, abyssal, and bathyal communities. Habitats have been mapped on the Bay, but at levels 2\textendash 4 in EUNIS. There are nearly 700 fish species, of which around 20 are commercial. The 42 species of marine mammals identified in the region represent 35\% of the total in the world. The disturbances produced by human activities are inputs of pollutants, physical disturbances, and impacts on biological communities and species. The impacts come from human settlements, extractive activities, industrial activities, building of infrastructures, as well as shipping and oil transport. The Bay is under the Oslo-Paris Convention and several locations have been protected, especially in coastal areas, but very few offshore. Under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, the environmental status has been assessed to be of good status, with some indicators needing improvement and better knowledge. The area will experience an important impact from global change, because of the retreat of cold water species, incoming of subtropical ones, and rise in sea level. Challenges for the future are related to biodiversity loss, invasive species, and global warming.},

We determined the diets of the most abundant intertidal fishes from 3 central California sites by examining gut contents. A matrix of dietary overlap among species within the Californian and Chilean assemblages (diets of Chilean fishes determined in another study) was constructed, and statistically significant guilds were determined using a bootstrapping procedure. Ten morphological features were examined for species in each region, and the relationship between diet and consumer morphology was evaluated. Three feeding guilds, omnivore, microcarnivore, and carnivore, were common to both regions, but a fourth guild, polychaete feeders, was unique to California. Feeding guild structure was not associated with phylogenetic relatedness within either assemblage. An assemblage-wide relationship between diet and morphology was found in each assemblage, but only a few associations between diet and morphology were common to both regions. In both California and Chile, omnivores tended to have longer digestive tracts and closer-set gill rakers, microcarnivores tended to have larger relative mouth heights, and all carnivorous fishes tended to have shorter guts and more widely spaced gill rakers. Overall, interregional morphological patterns were associated with phylogenetic relatedness, rather than with dietary similarities.},

It is also an essential step in the assessment of the functional diversity. Using two complementary three-matrix approaches (fourth-corner and RLQ analyses), we tested the hypothesis that feeding-oriented traits determine the spatial distributions of littoral fish species by assessing the relationship between fish spatial distributions, fish species traits, and habitat characteristics in two Laurentian Shield lakes. Significant associations between the feeding-oriented traits and the environmental characteristics suggested that fish communities in small lakes (displaying low species richness) can be spatially structured. Three groups of traits, mainly categorized by the species spatial and temporal feeding activity, were identified. The water column may be divided in two sections, each of them corresponding to a group of traits related to the vertical distribution of the prey coupled with the position of the mouth. Lake areas of low structural complexity were inhabited by functional assemblages dominated by surface feeders while structurally more complex areas were occupied by mid-water and benthic feeders. A third group referring to the time of feeding activity was observed. Our work could serve as a guideline study to evaluate species traits 3 environment associations at multiple spatial scales. Our results indicate that three-matrix statistical approaches are powerful tools that can be used to study such relationships. These recent statistical approaches open up new research directions such as the study of spatially based biological functions in lakes. They also provide new analytical tools for determining, for example, the potential size of freshwater protected areas.},

We propose a statistical framework to describe and compare environmental niches from occurrence and spatial environmental data. Location Europe, North America and South America. Methods The framework applies kernel smoothers to densities of species occurrence in gridded environmental space to calculate metrics of niche overlap and test hypotheses regarding niche conservatism. We use this framework and simulated species with pre-defined distributions and amounts of niche overlap to evaluate several ordination and species distribution modelling techniques for quantifying niche overlap. We illustrate the approach with data on two well-studied invasive species. Results We show that niche overlap can be accurately detected with the framework when variables driving the distributions are known. The method is robust to known and previously undocumented biases related to the dependence of species occurrences on the frequency of environmental conditions that occur across geographical space. The use of a kernel smoother makes the process of moving from geographical space to multivariate environmental space independent of both sampling effort and arbitrary choice of resolution in environmental space. However, the use of ordination and species distribution model techniques for selecting, combining and weighting variables on which niche overlap is calculated provide contrasting results. Main conclusions The framework meets the increasing need for robust methods to quantify niche differences. It is appropriate for studying niche differences between species, subspecies or intra-specific lineages that differ in their geographical distributions. Alternatively, it can be used to measure the degree to which the environmental niche of a species or intra-specific lineage has changed over time.},

He suggested three hypotheses about their function: "to store up the food," "putrify it up," and "concoct it" (i.e., storage, fermentation, and digestion). Our results for trout, cod, largemouth bass, and striped bass support the third but not the first or second of Aristotle's theories. In all four species, the caeca prove to be a major site of sugar, amino acid, and dipeptide uptake, contributing more uptake than the entire remaining alimentary tract in trout and cod. Caecal brush-border membranes contain hydrolytic enzymes. X-ray plates taken at various times after trout had ingested radioopaque marker, and observations of trout fed blue dye plus glass beads of graded sizes, show that caeca fill and empty of food with the same time course as proximal intestine. Thus, whereas the caeca of mammals and birds serve as fermentation chambers, fish caeca are an adaptation to increase gut surface area.},

It is thought that most of these flows are initiated by sediment failure or river floods. New observations from the Gulf of Lions (or Golfe du Lion) off the French coast near Marseille show that they are also triggered by 'dense shelf water cascading', a relatively common type of current in which cold, dense water flows off the continental shelf. This means that the transport of sediment and organic material to the deep ocean may be more significant than previously believed. Any changes in the amount of dense shelf water cascading caused by future climate change may have important implications for nutrient supply to deep ocean ecosystems, as well as for carbon storage in the deep ocean.},

Specimens were collected from 1987 to 1991, using bottom trawls at depths between 1000 and 2250 m. Prey selection was also examined in relation to data collected in the same area on 2 potential prey compartments for fish, the benthopelagic macrofauna\guilsinglleft suprabenthos or hyperbenthos\guilsinglleft and the megafaunal decapod crustaceans. Thus, the possible connections with prey availability within the benthic boundary layer (BBL) were also analysed. The size of available food resources was the most important factor responsible for food resource partitioning, both by depth stratum and season. The importance of the variable predator size is also evidenced. Most of the deep-sea demersal fish species inhabiting the Catalano-Balearic slope often consumed a variety of available resources in their diets, mainly comprising suprabenthos, but also infauna or planktonic prey. Thus, the BBL macrofauna constitute an important part of the available food exploited, with the range of the prey consumed increasing for the largest predators. A significant trend to increase dietary H{$^1$} values within the depth interval where each species attained its maximum abundance was observed. Some (positive) prey selection upon certain prey groups was detected depending on the fish species: sharks, Alepocephalus rostratus and Nettastoma melanurum preferentially preyed on decapods, siphonophores and pyrosomids; Polyacanthonotus rissoanus, macrourids, Lepidion lepidion and Cataetyx alleni preyed upon suprabenthic peracarid crustaceans; and only Bathypterois mediterraneus preferentially consumed copepods, the numerically dominant group in the bathyal BBL. Resource partitioning was high among the fish assemblage analysed in relation to the generally low dietary overlap values recorded. Overall, dietary overlap values among fish species decreased with increasing depth.},

We compare the functional diversity of entire fish communities in a shallow-water region with a deep-sea region for further insight into the differences between these ecosystem types. Location The regions compared in this study were selected to represent a shallow-water coastal region, Tasman and Golden Bays (TBGB), and a deep-sea region, Chatham Rise (CR), in New Zealand. Methods Functional diversity was assessed using four metrics: functional richness, evenness, divergence and dispersion. We compared these metrics across four key functions: habitat use, feeding, locomotion and life history. Results Our results showed that overall, the shallow-water and deep-sea ecosystems had equal diversity. When focusing on the four ecological functions, the two ecosystems exhibited equal diversity metrics across most analyses. Of the significantly different results, the deep-sea had higher functional richness for habitat use and locomotion traits, lower functional dispersion for feeding and lower functional evenness for life history. Main conclusions Differences across the functions highlight higher diversity of habitat utilization by deep-sea fish, while lower diversity in feeding suggests deep-sea fish tend towards generalist diets, likely driven by low food availability. Deep-sea fish displayed an increased range of locomotive traits in our analyses, but this conflicts with existing evidence and warrants further study. Life-history results suggest deep-sea fish exhibit higher clustering of traits, indicating potential under-utilization of life-history strategies in the deep-sea. Our results demonstrate that although deep-sea fish communities have similar levels of diversity to shallow-water communities, the traits that structure this diversity differ, and therefore, the systems may respond to exploitation differently.},

  abstract = {Myctophids are mesopelagic fishes belonging to family Myctophidae. They are represented by approx. 250 species in 33 genera. Called as ``Lanternfishes'', they inhabit all oceans except the Arctic. They are well-known for exhibiting adaptations to oxygen minimum zones (OMZ-in the upper 2,000m) and also performing diel vertical migration between the meso- and epipelagic regions. True to their name, lanternfishes possess glowing effect due to the presence of the photophores systematically arranged on their body, one of the important characteristic adding to their unique ecological features. Mid-water trawling is a conventional method of catching these fishes which usually accounts for biomass approx. in million tones as seen in Arabian Sea (20\textendash 100 million) or Southern ocean (70\textendash 200 million). Ecologically, myctophids link primary consumers like copepods, euphausiids and top predators like squids, whales and penguins in a typical food web. Lantern fishes become a major part of deep scattering layers (DSL) during migration along with other fauna such as euphausiids, medusae, fish juveniles, etc. Like any other marine organisms, Myctophids are susceptible to parasites like siphonostomatoid copepods, nematode larvae etc. in natural habitats. They are important contributors of organic carbon in the form of their remnants and fast sinking faeces, which get deposited on ocean beds. Economically, they are a good source of protein, lipids and minerals, which is used as fishmeal for poultry and animal feed and as crop fertilizers. Few species are considered edible, but proper processing difficulties on a higher scale limit myctophids as human food. Myctophids have a life span of approx. 1\textendash 5years and low fecundity rates (100\textendash 2,000 eggs per spawn). This trait is a disadvantage, if continuous utilization of their population, for e.g., for fish meal industries etc., occurs without giving them a chance to revive and recover. Hence, research in this area also should be given utmost importance. In this paper, we have tried to compile information and ideas from various sources of myctophid research around the world, particularly from the Indian Ocean, to understand their ecological and economic importance and also to put forth new ideas to bring about conservation and restoration of this vulnerable resource.

  abstract = {We have studied growth, energy use and reproduction in 4 mesopelagic fishes and 5 bathypelagic fishes living off Southern California (USA). All of the mesopelagic species underwent diurnal vertical migrations, while none of the bathypelagic species did so. The life histories of these pelagic fishes were compared among themselves and with epipelagic sardines and anchovies studied by others. The epipelagic species had the highest growth rates (estimated from otoliths, expressed in standard length or kilocalories), the mesopelagic species had the lowest growth rates and the bathypelagic species had intermediate growth rates. The relatively rapid growth rates of the bathypelagic fishes were achieved by high relative growth efficiencies made possible by low metabolic rates. Of the species studied, the lifespans of the epipelagic and bathypelagic species ranged from 4 to 8 yr and the lifespans of mesopelagic species from 5 to 8 yr. Data on egg diameters suggest that the mesopelagic species first reproduce in their 3rd yr, while the bathypelagic species do so in their last year. Epipelagic fishes generally have a large size, rapid growth, long life and early, repeated reproduction. Mesopelagic fishes are characterized by small size, slow growth, long life and early, repeated reproduction. Bathypelagic fishes generally have large size, rapid growth, somewhat shorter lives and late reproduction, which is possible a single event. The latter pattern is evidently feasible only in a rather stable environment where juvenile survivorship would always display relatively low variability. Many unusual characteristics of deep-living animals have possibly been selected by factors peculiar to the environment; however, such characteristics are just as likely to have been selected by factors equally present in many other environments, but not expressed there due to masking selective forces. In particular, we have in mind the darkness, stability and homogeneity of the bathypelagic realm as phenomena which represent the effective absence of many selective forces.},

  abstract = {The foraging ecology of fish is often considered to be the primary determinant of body shape due to tight links between morphology, swimming performance, and foraging efficiency. Fish foraging on littoral benthic macroinvertebrates typically have a deeper body shape than those foraging on pelagic zooplankton in the water column. However, morphological traits often have multiple ecological functions, which could result in performance trade-offs between functions. Here, we provide the first examination of body shape and diet in a species with alternative reproductive tactics, in this case, bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus Rafinesque, 1819). Bluegill males mature into either ``parental'' or ``cuckolder'' reproductive tactics. Parentals build nests and provide sole parental care and defense of the young. Cuckolders instead act as ``sneakers'' darting into the nests of parental males while mating is occurring and then later in life become ``satellites,'' mimicking female appearance and behavior. Using stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic analysis of diet, we found that parentals and females consumed primarily pelagic zooplankton yet were the deepest in body shape. Sneakers consumed more littoral resources but were the most streamlined. Satellite males also consumed predominately littoral resources but had a deeper body form that was more similar to females than to size-matched juveniles. Our results differ from past studies of foraging ecomorphology and suggest that other selection pressures, such as sexual selection in species with alternative reproductive tactics, may also be an important factor influencing shape.},

However, little is known about the influence of lateral particle transport from continental margins to deep-sea ecosystems. To address this question, we report here how the formation of dense shelf waters and their subsequent downslope cascade, a climate induced phenomenon, affects the population of the deep-sea shrimp Aristeus antennatus. We found evidence that strong currents associated with intense cascading events correlates with the disappearance of this species from its fishing grounds, producing a temporary fishery collapse. Despite this initial negative effect, landings increase between 3 and 5 years after these major events, preceded by an increase of juveniles. The transport of particulate organic matter associated with cascading appears to enhance the recruitment of this deep-sea living resource, apparently mitigating the general trend of overexploitation. Because cascade of dense water from continental shelves is a global phenomenon, we anticipate that its influence on deep-sea ecosystems and fisheries worldwide should be larger than previously thought.},

  abstract = {Only a miniscule fraction of the world's largest volume of living space, the ocean's midwater biome, has ever been sampled. As part of the International Census of Marine Life field project on Mid-Atlantic Ridge ecosystems (MAR-ECO), a discrete-depth trawling survey was conducted in 2009 aboard the NOAA FSV Henry B. Bigelow to examine the pelagic faunal assemblage structure and distribution over the Charlie-Gibbs Fracture Zone (CGFZ) of the northern Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Day/night sampling at closely spaced stations allowed the first characterization of diel vertical migration of pelagic nekton over the MAR-ECO study area. Discrete-depth sampling from 0\textendash 3000m was conducted using a Norwegian ``Krill'' trawl with five codends that were opened and closed via a pre-programmed timer. Seventy-five species of fish were collected, with a maximum diversity and biomass observed between depths of 700\textendash 1900m. A gradient in sea-surface temperature and underlying watermasses, from northwest to southeast, was mirrored by a similar gradient in ichthyofaunal diversity. Using multivariate analyses, eight deep-pelagic fish assemblages were identified, with depth as the primary discriminatory variable. Strong diel vertical migration (DVM) of the mesopelagic fauna was a prevalent feature of the study area, though the numerically dominant fish, Cyclothone microdon (Gonostomatidae), exhibited a broad (0\textendash 3000m) vertical distribution and did not appear to migrate on a diel basis. Three patterns of vertical distribution were observed in the study area: (a) DVM of mesopelagic, and possibly bathypelagic, taxa; (b) broad vertical distribution spanning meso- and bathypelagic depths; and (c) discrete vertical distribution within a limited depth range. Overall species composition and rank order of abundance of fish species agreed with two previous expeditions to the CGFZ (1982\textendash 1983 and 2004), suggesting some long-term consistency in the ichthyofaunal composition of the study area, at least in the summer. Frequent captures of putative bathypelagic fishes, shrimps, and cephalopods in the epipelagic zone (0\textendash 200m) were confirmed. The results of this expedition reveal distributional patterns unlike those previously reported for open-ocean ecosystems, with the implication of increased transfer efficiency of surface production to great depths in the mid-North Atlantic.},

The consequence of this blind spot means species with the most distinct ecological strategies might be lost. Here, we quantify ecological distinctiveness, based on six traits, for 10,960 bird and 5,278 mammal species, summarizing species-level ecological irreplaceability. We find that threatened birds and mammals are, on average, more ecologically distinct. Specific examples of ecologically distinct and highly threatened species are Great Indian Bustard, Amsterdam Albatross, Asian Elephant and Sumatran Rhinoceros. These species have potentially irreplaceable ecological roles and their loss could undermine the integrity of ecological processes and functions. Yet, we also identify ecologically distinct widespread generalists, such as Lesser Black-backed Gull and Wild Boar. These generalist species have distinct ecological strategies that allow them to thrive across multiple environments. Thus, we suggest that high ecological distinctiveness is associated with either high extinction risk or successful hyper-generalism. We also find that ecologically distinct species are generally charismatic (using a previous measure of public perceptions of charisma). We thus highlight a conservation opportunity: capitalizing on public preferences for charismatic species could provide support for the conservation of the most ecologically distinct birds and mammals. Overall, our prioritization framework supports the conservation of species with irreplaceable ecological strategies, complementing existing frameworks that target extinction risk and evolutionary distinctiveness.},

A backbone of classic niche theory is that local coexistence of competitors is favoured by the contraction or divergence of species' niches. However, this effect should depend on the diversity of resources available in the local environment, particularly when resources vary in multiple ecological dimensions. Here, we investigated how available resource breadth (i.e. prey diversity) and competition together shape multidimensional niche variation (between and within individuals) and interspecific niche overlap in 42 populations of congeneric tropical frog species. We modelled realized niches in two key trophic dimensions (prey size and carbon stable isotopes) and sampled available food resources to quantify two-dimensional resource breadth. We found a 14-fold variation in multidimensional population niche width across populations, most of which was accounted for by within-individual diet variation. This striking variation was predicted by an interaction whereby individual niche breadth increased with resource breadth and decreased with the number of congeneric competitors. These ecological gradients also interact to influence the degree of niche overlap between species, which surprisingly decreased with population total niche width, providing novel insights on how similar species can coexist in local communities. Together, our results emphasize that patterns of exploitation of resources in multiple dimensions are driven by both competitive interactions and extrinsic factors such as local resource breadth.},

Ecosystemic surveys enabled the determination of the trophic structure of the fish assemblages in three French marine ecosystems, namely the Eastern English Channel, the Bay of Biscay and the Gulf of Lions, through the simultaneous collection of qualitative (stable isotopes and energy content) and quantitative (biomass) data. In the Bay of Biscay and in the Gulf of Lions, pelagic primary production supported at least 80\% of the fish biomass production, and explained the dominance of pelagic species, but with differences resulting from the different productivity. The lower productivity in the oligotrophic Gulf of Lions led to a lower total biomass, energy density as well as the predominance of zooplankton-feeders. In contrast, fluxes in the Bay of Biscay were sufficient to support a higher biomass of pelagic piscivores, and of species with higher energy content. In the shallow Eastern English Channel, the respective contributions of pelagic and benthic sources were similar. Bentho-demersal species of higher trophic level dominated this assemblage, because of their ability to exploit both pathways. Results of the present study confirmed that fisheries-focused surveys can be used as efficient platforms to address questions about ecosystem functioning. Here, it confirmed the expected differences between ecosystems and the importance of primary production and environment as drivers of fish assemblage structure and functioning. Future studies should nevertheless develop new methods to better assess the paramount role of low trophic level consumers.},

  abstract = {Background Recent investigations suggest that biodiversity loss might impair the functioning and sustainability of ecosystems. Although deep-sea ecosystems are the most extensive on Earth, represent the largest reservoir of biomass, and host a large proportion of undiscovered biodiversity, the data needed to evaluate the consequences of biodiversity loss on the ocean floor are completely lacking. Results Here, we present a global-scale study based on 116 deep-sea sites that relates benthic biodiversity to several independent indicators of ecosystem functioning and efficiency. We show that deep-sea ecosystem functioning is exponentially related to deep-sea biodiversity and that ecosystem efficiency is also exponentially linked to functional biodiversity. These results suggest that a higher biodiversity supports higher rates of ecosystem processes and an increased efficiency with which these processes are performed. The exponential relationships presented here, being consistent across a wide range of deep-sea ecosystems, suggest that mutually positive functional interactions (ecological facilitation) can be common in the largest biome of our biosphere. Conclusions Our results suggest that a biodiversity loss in deep-sea ecosystems might be associated with exponential reductions of their functions. Because the deep sea plays a key role in ecological and biogeochemical processes at a global scale, this study provides scientific evidence that the conservation of deep-sea biodiversity is a priority for a sustainable functioning of the worlds' oceans.},

The analysis of local ({$\alpha$}) diversity at equal depths showed the presence of similar values in the NE Atlantic and Mediterranean deep-sea sediments. The comparison of the {$\alpha$} diversity between different deep-sea habitats (canyons versus adjacent open slopes) revealed the lack of significant differences in species richness in most of the investigated systems. However, the analysis of nematode species composition showed the presence of major differences among different sampling depths (i.e. 500 versus 1000 versus 2000 m depth) and habitats. Turnover ({$\beta$}) diversity was high in all of the investigated deep-sea systems, but was higher in the NE Atlantic (87\%) than in the Mediterranean margins (range 51 to 60\%), resulting in higher values of regional ({$\gamma$}) diversity in the Atlantic margin. Turnover diversity among regions ({$\delta$} diversity) was highest (\textasciitilde 91\%) between the NE Atlantic and western Mediterranean, but still extremely high between the western and central Mediterranean margins (\textasciitilde 80\%), thus leading to similar values of biogeographical diversity ({$\epsilon$}) in the NE Atlantic and Mediterranean deep biogeographical provinces. The results suggest that biogeographic differences in deep-sea species composition are related to differences in {$\beta$} and {$\delta$} diversity and not to differences in {$\alpha$} diversity, and that the analysis of the factors driving {$\beta$} diversity are crucial to understand the spatial patterns of biodiversity in the deep sea.},

The physiological mechanisms allowing organisms to adapt to extreme conditions of the deep ocean (high pressures, from very low to very high temperatures, food shortage, lack of solar light) are still largely unknown. Some deep-sea species have very long life-spans, whereas others can tolerate toxic compounds at high concentrations; these characteristics offer an opportunity to explore the specialized biochemical and physiological mechanisms associated with these responses. Widespread symbiotic relationships play fundamental roles in driving host functions, nutrition, health, and evolution. Deep-sea organisms communicate and interact through sound emissions, chemical signals and bioluminescence. Several giants of the oceans hunt exclusively at depth, and new studies reveal a tight connection between processes in the shallow water and some deep-sea species. Limited biological knowledge of the deep-sea limits our capacity to predict future response of deep-sea organisms subject to increasing human pressure and changing global environmental conditions.

The level of traits discrimination (measurement resolution) can have consequences for how good diversity patterns correlate with predictor variables. Here, we develop a novel framework to evaluate: i) how much information is lost when the measurement resolution of functional traits is lowered, and; ii) to what extent morphological traits and phylogeny can be used as surrogates of feeding strategy. We also tested whether measurement resolution of traits affects the ability of community functional diversity metrics to discriminate different habitats. We used empirical data from marine fish communities and correlated pairwise dissimilarities based on the most detailed measurement resolution of diet with pairwise dissimilarities based on different resolutions of diet, ecomorphology, and phylogeny. We then compared functional diversity between three marine regions using the different feeding trait resolutions, phylogeny and ecomorphology to detect environment filtering. Phylogeny and ecomorphological traits were not correlated with fish diet. There was a strong correlation between the highest and second highest measurement resolution, with the association decaying for lower resolution data. Significantly, high-resolution data are better able to discriminate different habitats than functional diversity. These results do not support the use of surrogates for trophic traits and highlight the importance of measurement resolution in studies of functional diversity in tropical marine ecosystems},

  abstract = {Acoustic survey methods are useful to estimate the distribution, abundance, and biomass of mesopelagic fish, a key component of open ocean ecosystems. However, mesopelagic fish pose several challenges for acoustic biomass estimation based on their small size, wide depth range, mixed aggregations, and length-dependent acoustic reflectance, which differentiate them from the larger epipelagic and neritic fish for which these methods were developed. Foremost, there is a strong effect of depth on swimbladder resonance, so acoustic surveys of mesopelagic fish must incorporate depth-stratification. Additionally, the 1\textendash 3 cm juveniles of many species are not only more abundant, but can also be stronger acoustic backscatterers than the larger adults that comprise most of the biomass. The dominant species in terms of biomass may thus be weak acoustic backscatters. Failure to properly incorporate depth, the full size distribution, and certain less-abundant species into mesopelagic acoustic analyses could lead to errors in estimated biomass of up to three orders of magnitude. Thus, thorough validation, or ``ground-truthing '', of the species composition, depth structure, population size distribution, capture efficiency of the sampling device, and acoustic properties of the fish present is critical for credible acoustic estimates of mesopelagic fish biomass. This is not insurmountable, but requires more ancillary data than is usually collected.},

Despite their importance, very little is known about their physiology or how they use their sensory systems to survive in the extreme conditions of the deep sea. In this study, we provide a comprehensive description of the general morphology of the myctophid eye, based on analysis of 53 different species, to understand better their visual capabilities. Results confirm that myctophids possess several visual adaptations for dim-light conditions, including enlarged eyes, an aphakic gap, a tapetum lucidum, and a pure rod retina with high densities of long photoreceptors. Two novel retinal specializations were also discovered. The first specialization is a fundal pigmentation in adult eyes, found within an isolated retinal region (typically central retina) composed of modified pigment epithelial cells, which we hypothesize to be the remnant of a more pronounced visual specialization important in larval stages. The second specialization is an aggregation of extracellular microtubular-like structures found within the sclerad region of the inner nuclear layer of the retina. We hypothesize that the marked interspecific differences in the hypertrophy of these microtubular-like structures may be related to inherent differences in visual function. A general interspecific variability in other parts of the eye is also revealed and examined in this study. The contribution of both ecology and phylogeny to the evolution of ocular specializations and vision in dim light are discussed.},

  author = {De Leo, F.C},
  year = {2012},
  month = aug,
  abstract = {Submarine canyons are abundant features along continental and oceanic island margins that connect continental shelves to deep ocean basins. Patterns of benthic community structure and productivity have been studied in a small number (45, or less than 0.7\%) of submarine canyons globally. Previous findings suggest that enhanced habitat heterogeneity and organic input in canyons are responsible for enhancing benthic biodiversity and creating biomass hotspots. However, because of the physical complexity of canyon habitats, predictions concerning the effects of canyons on local (alpha), turn-over (beta), and regional (gamma) diversity are not straightforward since a variety environmental and physical characteristics (e.g., topography, current regime, sediment availability, and quantity and quality of organic matter supply) interact, often nonmonotonically, in canyon habitats. Very few studies have systematically considered a broad range of habitat heterogeneity characteristics and their influence on canyon benthic biomass and biodiversity. Based on an extensive literature review, here I devise a conceptual model that helps to predict mechanistically the effects of environmental drivers on patterns of benthic community structure and biodiversity in canyons. Subsequently, testable hypotheses are proposed based on this conceptual model. The model framework employs the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (Connell, 1978) and meta-community model theory (reviewed in Leibold et al., 2004) to make predictions. Two central hypotheses ('The Habitat Heterogeneity Hypothesis' and the Organic Enrichment Hypothesis') were then tested for submarine canyons in the Hawaiian Islands and on the eastern New Zealand Margin. The set of canyons studied encompasses a wide range in physical habitat characteristics as well as boundary constraints, which is suitable for testing a general canyon-biodiversity-hotspot hypothesis. The Hawaiian canyons are embedded in the oligotrophic North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG) while canyons in New Zealand experience one of the highest reported sediment inputs from major riverine systems, as well as large inputs of coastal and pelagic organic matter. Within the Hawaiian archipelago, despite the predominantly oligotrophic conditions, canyons in the main high islands (MHI) (Oahu and Moloka!i) receive higher loads of coastal detritus (terrestrial plants and macroalgae) than canyons in the low Northwest Hawaiian Islands (NWHI), which are carbonate platforms and atolls. The first primary hypothesis that submarine canyons harbor enhanced habitat heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales relative to open slope habitats was supported for most of the canyon systems investigated. Exceptions to this general rule were evident in the submarine canyons off the low NWHI, Maro Reef and Nihoa Island, where 'canyon effects' on benthic macrofaunal community structure and overall abundance were not perceived. The Kaikoura Canyon system off the eastern New Zealand margin harbors a high degree of habitat heterogeneity from spatial scales ranging from meters to a few kilometers related to macrofaunal and megafaunal bioturbation activity. The second main hypothesis stating that canyons show enhanced organic matter enrichment relative to slopes was also supported for most but not all the canyons studied. As for the 'habitat heterogeneity hypothesis', organic enrichment was evident in the form of higher macrofaunal abundances in Kaikoura Canyon and also in the three canyons (Pelekunu, Kawainui and Kaneohe canyon) off the MHI, but not for the canyons off Maro Reef and Nihoa Island (NWHI). The lack of 'canyon effects' in the NWHI both in terms of abundance, alpha and beta-diversity is thought to result from reduced habitat heterogeneity and sparse detrital organic enrichment, resulting from relatively weak forcing on canyons from low islands/reefs. Absence of 'canyon effects' on fish and macrobenthic invertebrate community structure, abundance and diversity in canyons off Moloka'i and Oahu are attributed to a mid-depth oxygen minimum zone and to enhanced physical disturbance (strong bottom currents) at the heads of these canyons. For those canyon systems where enhanced habitat heterogeneity and organic enrichment were indicated, the overall benthic biodiversity was higher than on slopes, particularly at beta scales. These results further demonstrate that canyons often enhance faunal abundance and diversity at local scales (where physical disturbance is moderate) but more significantly at beta scales. This information has strong implications for marine spatial planning and conservation, and inclusion of entire canyon features in marine protected areas aimed at the protection of biodiversity hotspots.},

  abstract = {A methodological approach based on fish ecomorphology was chosen to predict potential fish diet. This study tests a method used in earlier research on a marine ecosystem containing phylogenetically diverse organisms: the North Sea. Fish feeding morphology imposes constraints on feeding options. A bottom-up perspective was used to describe the demands that food makes on fish feeding morphology. A set of quantitative morphological variables were measured on fish and compared to the demands made by different food-categories. Common North Sea Gadiformes and Pleuronectiformes were analysed. The results of the measurements were used as a basis for predictions of potential diet. Five `morphotypes' were identified: Large-mouthed flatfish, smallmouthed flatfish, soles, ling/rockling/haddock and other Gadiformes. The predictions on diet were checked by stomach content data from literature. The main conclusions were that morphology differed significantly among fish species indicating detailed morphological adaptations to specific food types. Furthermore the utilization of fast, relatively large prey were predicted better than the utilization of slow or sessile prey that is well hidden, hard to crack or otherwise `tough to handle'. Also the method failed to clearly separate different food types within this group of fast/large prey. Moreover, no clear distinction in stomach contents were found between Large-mouthed flatfish (being predicted as eating mostly shrimp) and Gadiformes (being predicted as eating mostly fish) within the group of fast prey hunters. Overall predictions succeed in separating different feeding guilds, but in some cases do not succeed in distinguishing between species. Knowledge on feeding behaviour on slow and sedentary benthic prey is a limiting factor. Also limiting the usefulness of the study is the incomplete knowledge and/or implementation of this knowledge on the distribution of both benthic fish and benthic prey items.},

  abstract = {The P\'elagiques Gascogne (PELGAS) integrated survey has been developed by a multidisciplinary team of Ifremer and La Rochelle University scientists since 2000, joined by commercial fishermen in 2007. Its initial focus was to assess the biomass and predict the recruitment success of anchovy in the Bay of Biscay in spring. Taking advantage of the space and versatility of R/V Thalassa II, sampling has been progressively extended to other ecosystem components. PELGAS therefore further developed the second objective of monitoring and studying the dynamic and diverse Biscay pelagic ecosystem in springtime. The PELGAS survey model has allowed for the establishment of a long-term time-series of spatially-explicit data of the Bay of Biscay pelagic ecosystem since the year 2000. Main sampled components of the targeted ecosystem are: hydrology, phytoplankton, mesozooplankton, fish and megafauna. The survey now provides two main ecosystem products: standard raster maps of ecosystem parameters, and a time series dataset of indicators of the Bay of Biscay pelagic ecosystem state. They are used to inform fish stock and ecosystem-based management, and support ecosystem research. The present paper introduces the PELGAS survey, as a practical example of an integrated, vessel-based, ecosystem survey. The evolution of the PELGAS scientific team and sampling protocols are presented and analysed, to outline factors crucial to the success of the survey. Data and results derived from PELGAS are reviewed, to exemplify scientific questions that can be tackled by integrated ecosystem survey data. Advantages and challenges of the survey are discussed and put into the context of marine ecosystem surveys in the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive and the Common Fisheries Policy.},

  abstract = {Species of the family Sternoptychidae (hatchetfishes) occur worldwide and play critical roles by sequestering carbon, recycling nutrients, and acting as a key trophic link between epipelagic primary consumers and higher trophic levels in marine ecosystems. Nevertheless, basic knowledge on their ecology is still lacking and their functional ecology remains understudied with respect to composition, organization, functions and environment interactions. Here we integrated comprehensive information collected in the western Tropical Atlantic on the diversity, abundance, distribution and trophic ecology of hatchetfishes, including physicochemical features of their habitats and extensive carbon and nitrogen stable isotope data on its main prey groups. On this basis we defined five functional groups of hatchetfishes with different diet preference, isotopic composition, and vertical abundance peaks and reveal a possible high resource partitioning. Additionally, these species might have a different feeding tie chronology. Hence, hatchetfishes segregate in different ecological groups responding differently to environmental constraints including oxygen concentration and presenting diverse functional roles. As deep-sea species that migrate to epipelagic waters, hatchetfishes may play a key role in the transfer of subsurface photoassimilated carbon to deeper waters, a pathway through which the effects of climate change at the surface are transferred to the deep ocean. Moreover, as consumers of gelatinous organisms, these species convert ``gelatinous energy'' into ``fish energy'' readily usable by higher trophic levels, including endangered and commercially important species. This is a crucial trophic relationship that has been historically underestimated due to methodology limitations (e.g., quickly digested gelatinous organisms were probably underestimated in previous studies, based solely on stomach contents). Considering in ecosystem models this trophic relationship, as well as the functional organization of hatchetfishes, is important to properly answer key ecological questions including resource use, carbon transportation, and influence of mesopelagic community in climate change process.},

In such a situation, we need to understand the nature of the change and to make predictions about the way in which it might affect systems of interest; often we may also wish to understand what might be done to mitigate the predicted effects. In ecology, we usually make such predictions (or forecasts) by making use of mathematical models that describe the system and projecting them into the future, under changed conditions. Approaches emphasizing the desirability of simple models with analytical tractability and those that use assumed causal relationships derived statistically from data currently dominate ecological modelling. Although such models are excellent at describing the way in which a system has behaved, they are poor at predicting its future state, especially in novel conditions. In order to address questions about the impact of environmental change, and to understand what, if any, action might be taken to ameliorate it, ecologists need to develop the ability to project models into novel, future conditions. This will require the development of models based on understanding the processes that result in a system behaving the way it does, rather than relying on a description of the system, as a whole, remaining valid indefinitely.},

  abstract = {This study examined the population structure, reproductive cycle and feeding pattern of the lanternfish Lampanyctus crocodilus in the Balearic Basin (north-west Mediterranean Sea) from a depth of 450 to 1800 m and at a seasonal scale. Juveniles were mainly located at shallower depths, but also at deepest stations in autumn, while adults mostly inhabited intermediate depths with their centre of population density (CPD) located at 800\textendash 1000 m of depth. The migration of adults to deeper depths was detected in late summer to autumn, probably linked to the occurrence of nepheloid layers at c. 1200 m, which in turn enhances the biomass of the zooplankton prey. The diet was mainly based on euphausiids and mysids, with marked seasonal variations both on the upper (450\textendash 800 m) and lower (1000\textendash 1800 m), where suprabenthic gammariids and pelagic decapods were also dominant. Stomach fullness increased from winter to autumn on the US, while it had a maximum in spring on the LS, in parallel with high consumption of gelatinous zooplankton, which is probably more available after the phytoplankton bloom in late winter. Reproduction occurred in winter, confirmed by the higher percentage of mature females and high gonadosomatic indices (IG) at both depth ranges. Hepatosomatic indices (IH) showed an inverse trend to IG on the US, except in autumn, and was almost parallel on the LS, probably attributable to the migration of adults, which determined different temporal schemes in energy use and storage for reproduction on the US v. LS. Consistent with the different patterns observed at the two depth ranges, environmental drivers of fullness (i.e. feeding intensity) and IG (as a proxy of reproductive cycle) differed on the US and LS. The biomass of mysids and euphausiids was the greatest explanatory variables of fullness on the US and LS, pointing to the increasing feeding intensity when a resource was more available. IH also explained fullness, suggesting that greater feeding intensity in pre-reproductive periods enabled energy storage in the liver. IG was linked directly (i.e. mysids) or indirectly (i.e. surface primary production recorded 2 months before sampling) to food availability, implying a rapid response to vertical food inputs by deep-sea predators. Also, IG in L. crocodilus was related to population density, which suggests aggregations for reproduction. Estimates of L. crocodilus trophic levels, and of other accompanying mesopelagic fishes, indicated that the species feed through a continuum spanning the third trophic level, confirming the key role of mesopelagic fishes in transferring organic carbon between trophic levels. Trophic niche segregation among mesopelagic species was pronounced and non-overlapping groups could be distinguished because of the different vertical distribution and migratory behaviour. The study highlights the important role of the benthic boundary layer in sustaining benthopelagic communities in the deep Mediterranean Sea and the need to study the biology of a species throughout its whole depth range and not just at exploited depths (i.e. fishing grounds).},

  abstract = {The morphological and functional traits of fishes are key factors defining the ecological and biological habits of species within ecosystems. However, little is known about how the depth gradient affects these factors. In the present study, several demersal fish assemblages from the Balearic Islands (western Mediterranean Sea) along a wide depth range (40\textendash 2200m) were morphologically, functionally and ecologically described. The morphological characterization of communities was performed using geometric morphometric methods, while the functional structures were obtained by the functional categorization of species and the application of principal coordinates analysis (PCoA). The results revealed that morphospaces presented less richness of body forms as depth increases, although they showed a progressive spreading of species toward the periphery, with a proliferation of more extreme body traits, demonstrating lower morphological redundancy. In addition, a trend toward the elongation of body shape was also observed with depth. Moreover, functional diversity increased with bathymetry up to 1400m, where it sharply decreased downwards. This decrease was parallel to a progressive fall of H{${'}$} (ecological diversity) up to 2200m. Functional redundancy progressively decreased until the deepest assemblage (more constantly in the deeper levels), which was almost exclusively dominated by benthopelagic wandering species feeding on suprabenthos. Redundancy analysis (RDA) demonstrated that both morphological and functional spaces showed high variation along the bathymetric range. Mantel test indicated that the majority of species presented similar spatial distribution within the morphospace and functional space, although in the functional space the more abundant species were always located at the periphery. These results demonstrate that the assessment of the morpho-functional variation between marine communities helps to understand the processes that affect the structure and functioning of communities, such as resource partitioning, trophic interactions, or interspecific relationships within ecosystem such as coexistence and dominance.},

Pressures from human activities include fishing, dumping of land-based mine tailings, and oil and gas extraction. Moreover, hydrodynamic processes of canyons enhance the down-canyon transport of litter. The effects of climate change may modify the intensity of currents. This potential hydrographic change is predicted to impact the structure and functioning of canyon communities as well as affect nutrient supply to the deep-ocean ecosystem. This review not only identifies the ecological status of canyons, and current and future issues for canyon conservation, but also highlights the need for a better understanding of anthropogenic impacts on canyon ecosystems and proposes other research required to inform management measures to protect canyon ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Summary The swimming abilities of fishes are of vital importance to their ecology, and studies on fish swimming have been the focus of research for over a century. Here we explore the relationship between swimming ability and external body morphology, using data on Ucrit swimming speeds of 100 species of pre-settlement juvenile coral reef fishes (at the transition between the larval and adult habitats), comprising 26 different families from 5 orders. The taxonomic diversity of this methodologically consistent dataset provides a unique opportunity to examine the relationship between form and function in fish swimming across a broad taxonomic range. Overall, we found that a predictive model incorporating total length (TL), the square of caudal peduncle depth factor (CPDF2) and aspect ratio (AR) can be used to accurately predict swimming performance of a wide range of fish families, and was able to explain 69\% of the variability in swimming performance of these pre-settlement juvenile fishes. The model was also able to successfully predict the swimming speed of an outgroup salmonid species (Oncorhynchus mykiss). There was no evidence that the model fit differed among taxonomic groups, despite the inclusion of five different orders of fishes, suggesting that body morphology sufficiently explains the bulk of differences in swimming performance. Furthermore, the model appears to work equally well for fishes from the Great Barrier Reef and the Caribbean, and for families with different adult habitat associations and swimming modes. It remains to be determined how well the model predicts the swimming abilities of temperate species as well as adults of these same species. This model provides an invaluable means of predicting swimming abilities of pre-settlement juvenile fishes that are unable to be reared in the laboratory, do not perform well in swimming flumes or are unable to be captured live in the field.},

Fish were collected using a mrozooplankton trawl during daylight hours at ten stations. Along the transect, 17 hydrographic stations were also performed with a CTD (Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth). A total of 130 fish taxa were identified. The dominant family was Gonostomatidae, with four species (Cyclothone braueri, Cyclothone microdon, Cyclothone pseudopallida, and Cyclothone pallida) being responsible of more than 78 \% of the total density. The most frequent species that appeared to be ubiquitous were C. braueri and C. pseudopallida, while Myctophidae was the most diverse family. Multivariate analyses revealed two clusters related with the latitudinal gradient. The fish community in the southern stations (25\textendash 37\textdegree N) was more diverse than in the northern stations (42\textendash 48\textdegree N). Temperature from 300 to 700 m depth explained 65 \% of variation in terms of density and 58 \% in terms of biomass, both statistically significant.

Yet the literature is inconsistent about the empirical correlation between functional traits and growth, casting doubt on the capacity of some prominent traits to influence growth rate. We propose that traits should influence growth in a way that depends on the size of individual plants. We outline mechanisms and hypotheses based on new theoretical work and test these predictions in tree species using a meta-analysis of 103 studies ({$>$} 500 correlations) for five traits (specific leaf area, wood density, maximum height, seed mass and maximum assimilation rate). We also recorded data for 14 other traits commonly used in the trait literature. To capture the effects of plant size, we tested for a shift in the direction of correlation between growth rates and each trait across three ontogenetic stages: seedling, sapling and adult. Results were consistent with predictions, although there were some limitations arising from unequal numbers of observation across ontogenetic stages. Specific leaf area was correlated with relative growth rate in seedlings but not in adult plants. Correlations of growth with wood density were not affected by ontogenetic stage. Seed mass, assimilation rate and maximum height were correlated with relative growth rate only in one ontogenetic stage category: seedlings, seedlings and adults, respectively. Although we were able to confirm several of our theoretical predictions, major knowledge gaps still exist in the trait literature. For example, for one-third of the traits considered, the majority ({$>$} 75\%) of reported correlations with growth came from the same ontogenetic stage. Synthesis. We show for some traits, how trait\textendash growth correlations change in a predictable way with plant size. Our understanding of plant strategies should shift away from describing species as having a fixed growth strategy throughout their life (on a continuous axis from slow to fast growth), in favour of a size-dependent growth trajectories.},

  abstract = {This book is an important addition to a growing body of literature on functional morphology\textemdash the study of form and structure in animals as related to the functions of the various body parts. The author is particularly concerned with clarifying the interrelationships between evolutionary changes in morphology and the classification of this large group of fishes. He starts from the premise that the classification should summarize evolutionary relationships and that major steps in evolution are expressed in modifications of functional systems. In the author's view, changes in the abilities of fish to maneuver in the water, to obtain food, and to force water over the gills\textemdash changes that are reflected in the morphology, particularly of skeletal elements\textemdash are among the most important advances that have been made within the teleostean group of fishes. With great skill and insight, Dr. Gosline develops these difficult concepts in the first section of the book. In working out his system of classification of teleosts, presented in the second section, the author's major effort was placed on clarifying the underlying zoological problems: he views the system primarily as a vehicle for discussing zoological information that suggests relationships between teleostean groups. Any student of zoology\textemdash not only ichthyologists\textemdash will welcome this original and thoughtful approach to problems of animal classification.},

In a 1,500-2,500-m depth range off New Jersey and Delaware, 233 30 x 30-cm samples contained 798 species in 171 families and 14 phyla. Addition of stations from sites to the north and south approximately doubled the number of samples and doubled the number of species to 1,597. Species-area curves do not level off within stations or when stations are added together. Moreover, the proportion of species represented by single individuals is high at all scales of sampling, which indicates that much more sampling is needed to adequately represent the species richness either locally or regionally. Diversity changes very little through time at a single site or with distance along a 180-km transect at a depth of 2,100 m. Diversity is maintained by a combination of biogenic microhabitat heterogeneity in a system with few barriers to dispersal, disturbance created by feeding activities of larger animals, and food resources divided into patches of a few square meters to square centimeters initiated by specific temporally separated events.},

A total of nine morphometric measurements (Total length, Standard length, Fork length, Body depth, Head Length, Pre-dorsal fin length, Pre-pelvic fin length, Pre-pectoral fin length, and Pre-anal fin length) and body weight were noted. Basic descriptive statistical analysis and correlation coefficient (r) were analysis with total length (independent variable) and other morphometric measurements (dependent variable). The result presented that except pre-pelvic fin with total length in (Labeo rohita and Cyprinus carpio) and pre-dorsal fin with total length in (Cirrhinus mrigala and Catla catla) others all morphometric dimensions are highly correlated with total length. Also the regression coefficient (b) was less than 3.0 which indicated that all other morphometric dimensions compared with total length shows negative allometric growth and the body weight with total length shows positive allometric growth in (Labeo rohita = 3.260), negative allometric growth in (Catla catla = 2.100 and Cyprinus carpio = 2.400) and isomeric growth in (Cirrhinus mrigala = 3.016).

These species were first assigned to eight broad trophic guilds based on stomach contents analysis. The relationships between diet and morphology were then examined using Redundancy Analysis, after having checked for potential phylogenetical effects. Results show that, independently of any phylogenetic constraints, some of the trophic guilds could be grossly predicted from few relevant morphological attributes (i.e. relative intestinal length, standard length and mouth orientation) and thus suggest a significant link between diet and morphology. In other words, species having similar diet tend to converge to some extent on some morphological attributes. This link was nevertheless rather weak, suggesting that even if morphology may set limits to patterns of resource use, these limits are broad enough to allow fishes changing their choice of prey resources to respond to local biotic and/or abiotic conditions.},

Populations of these columbines are subject to complex patterns of divergent selection across environments, which partly explain the taxonomic structure of the group. This suggests the hypothesis that niche divergence must have occurred along the process of diversification of the group.We used MaxEnt to build environmental niche models of seven subspecies belonging to the three species of Aquilegia present in the Iberian Peninsula. From these models, we compared the environmental niches through two different approaches: ENMtools and multivariate methods.MaxEnt distributions conformed closely to the actual distribution of the study taxa. ENMtools methods failed to uncover any clear patterns of niche differentiation or conservatism in Iberian columbines. Multivariate analyses indicate the existence of differentiation along altitudinal gradients and along a gradient of climatic conditions determined by the summer precipitation and temperatures. However, climatic conditions related to winter temperature and precipitation, as well as soil properties, were equally likely to show conservatism or divergence. The complex patterns of niche evolution we found suggest that Iberian Columbines have not been significantly constrained by forces of niche conservatism, so they could respond adaptively to the fast and profound climate changes in the Iberian Peninsula through the glacial cycles of the Pleistocene.},

The most numerous was the gonostomatid Cyclothone microdon while the myctophid Benthosema glaciale was next in number and first in weight. Most of those principal species would be expected in catches taken in oceanic waters beyond the shelf break, only the bottom-spawning Melanostigma atlanticum being, in the surveyed area, distinctively a species of the canyon. Multivariate analyses showed that the primary variations in the assemblage were aligned with drivers that act in open ocean: depth, water mass and both diel and seasonal cycles. However, the effect of the canyon was evident in an up-canyon decline in the catches of most species. We hypothesize that the oceanic species are passively carried into The Gully by the known inflow and are there exposed to intense predation, depleting their numbers. We estimate that biomass flux as sufficient to support the Marine Protected Area's signature species: northern bottlenose whales (Hyperoodon ampullatus).},

  abstract = {Predators typically are larger than their prey, and consequently, trophic level should increase with body size. Whereas this relationship has helped in developing predictions about food web structure and dynamics in mesocosms and simple communities, a trophiclevel\textendash body-size relationship may not exist for all kinds of communities or taxa, especially those with many non-carnivorous species. Moreover, functional traits associated with trophic level generally have not been considered. Herein, we examine the correlation between trophic level and body size in fishes and how this relationship may vary in relation to functional traits (body dimensions, mouth size and orientation, tooth shape, gill rakers, and gut length) and trophic guilds (carnivorous vs. non-carnivorous). We analyzed data from morphological measurements and dietary analyses performed on thousands of specimens from freshwater and estuarine habitats across three zoogeographic regions (Neartic, Neotropical, and Afrotropical). A positive relationship between trophic level and body size was only found for carnivorous fishes. No relationship was found when all species were analyzed together, rejecting the idea that trophic level is positively related with body size in fishes generally. This result was consistent even when using either body mass or standard length as the measure of body size, and trophic level for either species (average values) or individual specimens as the response variable. At the intraspecific level, trophic level varied consistently with size for one third of the species, among which only 40\% had positive relationships. Body depth, tooth shape, and mouth width were all associated with the trophic-level\textendash body-size relationship. Overall, predators with conical or triangular serrated teeth, large mouths, and elongated/and/or fusiform bodies tend to have positive trophic-level\textendash body-size relationships, whereas primarily non-carnivorous species with unicuspid or multicuspid teeth, deep bodies and small to medium sized mouth gapes tended to have negative relationships. Given the diverse ecological strategies encompassed by fishes, trophic level and food web patterns and processes should not be inferred based solely on body size. Research that integrates multiple functional traits with trophic ecology will improve understanding and predictions about food web structure and dynamics.},

  abstract = {Trait-based ecology, which focuses on using the traits of species and individuals to understand ecology (from populations to ecosystems), is becoming an increasingly productive and widely employed paradigm. To date, trait-based approaches have been used to study taxa from microbes to megafauna in every major area of aquatic ecology yielding exciting results. However, this promising field faces a number of significant obstacles, including: (1) identifying and measuring ecologically relevant traits, (2) integrating inter- and intra-specific trait variation, (3) detecting and quantifying trait correlations and trade-offs, and (4) accounting for the context dependency of traits. These issues are often particularly acute for specific taxa or systems. This paper highlights these looming challenges, as well as ways to address them. Proposed solutions center around using new technologies to collect trait data, coordinating research efforts, and curating and sharing data. Throughout, we take an interdisciplinary approach, sharing examples spanning a wide range of aquatic taxa and systems. It is our hope that this paper will stimulate frank discussions and help the growing field of trait-based aquatic ecology maximize its potential.},

  abstract = {A new framework for measuring functional diversity (FD) from multiple traits has recently been proposed. This framework was mostly limited to quantitative traits without missing values and to situations in which there are more species than traits, although the authors had suggested a way to extend their framework to other trait types. The main purpose of this note is to further develop this suggestion. We describe a highly flexible distance-based framework to measure different facets of FD in multidimensional trait space from any distance or dissimilarity measure, any number of traits, and from different trait types (i.e., quantitative, semi-quantitative, and qualitative). This new approach allows for missing trait values and the weighting of individual traits. We also present a new multidimensional FD index, called functional dispersion (FDis), which is closely related to Rao's quadratic entropy. FDis is the multivariate analogue of the weighted mean absolute deviation (MAD), in which the weights are species relative abundances. For unweighted presence\textendash absence data, FDis can be used for a formal statistical test of differences in FD. We provide the ``FD'' R language package to easily implement our distance-based FD framework.},

A common framework, including freshwater, marine, benthic, and pelagic ecologists, is needed to bridge communication gaps and foster knowledge sharing. This framework should transcend local specificities and taxonomy in order to provide a common ground and shareable tools to address common scientific challenges. Here, we advocate the use of functional trait-based approaches (FTBAs) for aquatic ecologists and propose concrete paths to go forward. Firstly, we propose to unify existing definitions in FTBAs to adopt a common language. Secondly, we list the numerous databases referencing functional traits for aquatic organisms. Thirdly, we present a synthesis on traditional as well as recent promising methods for the study of aquatic functional traits, including imaging and genomics. Finally, we conclude with a highlight on scientific challenges and promising venues for which FTBAs should foster opportunities for future research. By offering practical tools, our framework provides a clear path forward to the adoption of trait-based approaches in aquatic ecology.},

The present study examines the diets of the clupeoid, stomiatoid and salmonoid species occurring demersally and pelagically in the Rockall Trough to the west of Scotland and Ireland. Pelagic fish were collected between the surface and about 2 500-m depth between 1973 and 1978. Demersal fish were sampled at 250-m intervals of depths between 500- and 2 900-m depth during the years 1975 and 1981. Of the 28 species caught, 18 were strictly pelagic and dominated by the stomiatoids while five were strictly demersal. The remaining five species occurred in both the pelagic and demersal environment. The commonest clupeoid was Alepoeephalus bairdii, which is a dominant species within the demersal fish associations at depths of 750 to 1 250 m. This species, along with the deeper-living A. agassizi, and 3 other alepocephalid species feed primarily o n benthopelagic prey but also exploit the epibenthos. The stomiatoid species, such as Qvclothone microdon, C. braueri, Maurolieus muelleri and Arg/ropelecus hemigymnus, dominate the associations of pelagic fish in the Trough. They feed on different proportions of ostracods, copepods and amphipods. Of the salmonoids, only Argentina silus and Bathylagus euryops occurred commonly and both feed on benthopelagic fauna, the latter at much greater depths than the former. The principal factor acting to prevent direct competition between species is the modal centres of bathymetric distribution of the species. Other contributing factors are briefly discussed.},

C'est ce type d'\'ecosyst\`emes qui font souvent l'objet d'un statut de protection dans le cadre de l'\'etablissement d'une AMP. C'est dans ce contexte que nous nous sommes int\'eress\'es au peuplement ichthyique de la zone de Malloula, situ\'ee dans le Nord Ouest de la Tunisie.

Nous avons donc cherch\'e \`a pr\'eciser la structure fonctionnelle des peuplements de poissons de la Baie de Malloula en identifiant les diff\'erents groupes fonctionnels la composant. Pour cela, nous avons mesur\'e 19 traits \'ecomorphologiques sur les diff\'erents individus de chaque esp\`ece. Ces traits ont permis de calculer 17 traits fonctionnels (7 pour caract\'eriser la fonction de locomotion et 10 pour l'acquisition des ressources trophiques), dont les valeurs ont \'et\'e utilis\'ees pour faire une Analyse en Composante Principale (ACP) pour chaque fonction.

Parmi ces groupes fonctionnels, 7 sont monosp\'ecifiques comme (Sarpa salpa, Trachinus draco, Parablennius sanguinolentus, Lipophrys basiliscus, Solea vulgaris, Liza aurata et Gobius paganellus), c'est \`a dire qu'ils sont constitu\'es d'esp\`eces fonctionnellement uniques dont l'\'eventuelle disparition entra\^inera la disparition d\'efinitive de la fonction qu'elles assurent car elles ne seront pas remplac\'ees par des esp\`eces \'equivalentes.

The deep sea provides a natural environmental gradient within which to study changes in different diversity metrics, but traits of deep-sea fish are not widely known, hampering the application of functional diversity to this globally important system. We used morphological traits to determine the functional richness and functional divergence of demersal fish assemblages along the continental slope in the Northeast Atlantic, at depths of 300\textendash 2,000 m. We compared these metrics to size diversity based on individual body size and species richness. Functional richness and size diversity showed similar patterns, with the highest diversity at intermediate depths; functional divergence showed the opposite pattern, with the highest values at the shallowest and deepest parts of the study site. Species richness increased with depth. The functional implications of these patterns were deduced by examining depth-related changes in morphological traits and the dominance of feeding guilds as illustrated by stable isotope analyses. The patterns in diversity and the variation in certain morphological traits can potentially be explained by changes in the relative dominance of pelagic and benthic feeding guilds. All measures of diversity examined here suggest that the deep areas of the continental slope may be equally or more diverse than assemblages just beyond the continental shelf.},

  abstract = {Caudal fin skeletons of teleost fishes have been well-studied in the context of phylogenetic relationships. However, the small cartilages at the distal end of the diastema, the `median caudal cartilages', have gained only little attention so far. For the first time we here report their taxa-dependent variable three-dimensional structure. We investigated 143 species of 62 teleost families for this study. The shape and arrangement of these cartilages is uniform in some systematic groups, e.g. Alepocephalidae, Platytroctidae or Myctophiformes; in other taxa there is high intrataxon variability, e.g. Stomiiformes or Aulopiformes. Shape, number and presence/absence may even vary in certain species, e.g. Osmerus eperlanus, Thymallus thymallus or Gymnocorymbus ternetzi. The function of median caudal cartilages remains unclear. It has been suggested that they might be related to fin-ray support, although an obvious relation to fin rays is lacking in several taxa. Their presence and size is not dependent on the size of the diastema. Median caudal cartilages seem to have evolved at the base of clupeocephalans and occur in many taxa up to about aulopiforms, as well as single beryciforms. It seems that they are often reduced at different systematic levels and may have re-evolved in some taxa.},

  abstract = {The concept of niche overlap appears in studies of the mechanisms of the maintenance of species diversity, in searches for assembly rules, and in estimation of within-community species redundancy. For plant traits measured on a continuous scale, existing indices are inadequate because they split the scale into a number of categories thus losing information. An index is easy to construct if we assume a normal distribution for each trait within a species, but this assumption is rarely true. We extend and apply an index, NO(K), which is based on kernel density functions, and can therefore work with distributions of any shape without prior assumptions. For cases where the ecologist wishes to downweight traits that are inter-correlated, we offer a variant that does this: NO(Kw). From either of these indices, an index of the mean niche overlap in a community can be calculated: NO(K,community) and NO(Kw,community). For all these indices, the variance can be calculated and formulae for this are given. To give examples of the new indices in use, we apply them to a coastal fish dataset and a sand-dune plant dataset. The former exhibits considerable non-normality, emphasising the need for kernel-based indices. Accordingly, there was a considerable difference in index values, with those for an index based on a normal distribution being significantly higher than those from an index which, being based on kernel fitting, is not biased by an assumption for the distribution. The NO(K) values were ecologically consistent for the fish species concerned, varying from 0.02 to 0.53. The sand-dune plant data also showed a wide range of overlap values. Interestingly, the least overlap was between two graminoids, which would have been placed in the same functional group in the coarse classification often used in functional-type/ecosystem-function work.},

At the current meter mooring locations, interface cores were collected to characterize the recent sedimentation processes. In the two canyons located in the Northern part of the Bay of Biscay (Audierne and Blackmud), there is no evidence of recent sedimentary deposits. Canyons are by-passing or erosive areas. In the southern part of the Bay of Biscay (Capbreton), recent turbidite are deposited. In the three canyons, current meters recorded energetic currents with velocities showing alternating upslope and downslope motions, and a period corresponding to the semi-diurnal component M2. These currents are supposed to be related to deep internal tides. The high speed of the current (1m/s) in Audierne and Blackmud is consistent with the lack of preservation of recent sediments on the canyon floors. In Capbreton Canyon, the magnitude of currents is less and recent turbidites are preserved. In addition to periodical current motion, small magnitude gravity event corresponding to a low-concentration turbulent surge or a high-concentration nepheloid layer initiated during a storm was recorded during the mooring period. These results suggest that deep-sea canyons in the Bay of Biscay have behaviour at present varying between by passing or erosion areas and sediment trapping. These examples suggest that sediments are moved up and down by low-energy, tide-initiated hydrodynamic events during most of the time. During higher magnitude, short-duration gravity events, the sediments are transferred down canyon towards the deep sea.},

Does similar convergence exist in the molecular underpinnings of such morphological changes? Natarajan et al. looked across more than 50 species of birds that have adapted to different elevations to identify patterns of similarity in hemoglobin-oxygen binding affinity (see the Perspective by Bridgham). Increases in hemoglobin-oxygen binding affinity occurred in alpine species, but the molecular changes underlying the hemoglobin changes were variable. Thus, even in cases where adaptive phenotypic change is predictable, the molecular pathways to these changes may not be. Science, this issue p. 336; see also p. 289 To investigate the predictability of genetic adaptation, we examined the molecular basis of convergence in hemoglobin function in comparisons involving 56 avian taxa that have contrasting altitudinal range limits. Convergent increases in hemoglobin-oxygen affinity were pervasive among high-altitude taxa, but few such changes were attributable to parallel amino acid substitutions at key residues. Thus, predictable changes in biochemical phenotype do not have a predictable molecular basis. Experiments involving resurrected ancestral proteins revealed that historical substitutions have context-dependent effects, indicating that possible adaptive solutions are contingent on prior history. Mutations that produce an adaptive change in one species may represent precluded possibilities in other species because of differences in genetic background. Improvements in hemoglobin-oxygen affinity are convergent across taxa, but the genetic pathways are different.

Phenotypically, the Clarias-like Clariothalmus and the Pangapinus progenies were indistinguishable from their maternal parents while the Panga-like Clariothalmus was a phenotypic intermediary of the putative parents but looks more closely to the paternal parent. Hence, both univariate proportion and multivariate analysis of the collected data successfully separated the different fishes into three multivariate spaces. The analysis of the dendrogram with complete linkage and Euclidean distance further showed the close relationship of the isolated Panga-like Clariothalmus progenies to the paternal parent, however, Clarias-like Clariothalmus and the Pangapinus were completely intermingled with their maternal parents. The most important index of discrimination of these fishes into different multivariate spaces was the fin characteristic which showed 100\% exclusive ranges for the individual groups in many cases.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY 1. The prediction of species distributions is of primary importance in ecology and conservation biology. Statistical models play an important role in this regard; however, researchers have little guidance when choosing between competing methodologies because few comparative studies have been conducted. 2. We provide a comprehensive comparison of traditional and alternative techniques for predicting species distributions using logistic regression analysis, linear discriminant analysis, classification trees and artificial neural networks to model: (1) the presence/absence of 27 fish species as a function of habitat conditions in 286 temperate lakes located in south-central Ontario, Canada and (2) simulated data sets exhibiting deterministic, linear and non-linear species response curves. 3. Detailed evaluation of model predictive power showed that approaches produced species models that differed in overall correct classification, specificity (i.e. ability to correctly predict species absence) and sensitivity (i.e. ability to correctly predict speciespresence) and in terms of which of the study lakes they correctly classified. Onaverage, neural networks outperformed the other modelling approaches, although all approaches predicted species presence/absence with moderate to excellent success. 4. Based on simulated non-linear data, classification trees and neural networks greatly outperformed traditional approaches, whereas all approaches exhibited similar correct classification rates when modelling simulated linear data. 5. Detailed evaluation of model explanatory insight showed that the relative importance of the habitat variables in the species models varied among the approaches, where habitat variable importance was similar among approaches for some species and very different for others. 6. In general, differences in predictive power (both correct classification rate and identity of the lakes correctly classified) among the approaches corresponded with differences in habitat variable importance, suggesting that non-linear modelling approaches (i.e. classification trees and neural networks) are better able to capture and model complex, non-linear patterns found in ecological data. The results from the comparisons using simulated data further support this notion. 7. By employing parallel modelling approaches with the same set of data and focusing on comparing multiple metrics of predictive performance, researchers can begin to choose predictive models that not only provide the greatest predictive power, but also best fit the proposed application.},

  abstract = {Golden and Blueline Tilefish (Lopholatilus chamaeleonticeps and Caulolatilus microps) are keystone taxa in northwest (NW) Atlantic continental shelf-edge environments due to their biotic (trophic-mediated) and abiotic (ecosystem engineering) functional roles combined with high-value fisheries. Despite this importance, the ecological niche dynamics (i.e., those relating to trophic behavior and food-web interactions) of these sympatric species are poorly understood, knowledge of which may be consequential for maintaining both ecosystem function and fishery sustainability. We used stable isotope ratios of carbon ({$\delta$}13C) and nitrogen ({$\delta$}15N) to build realized ecological niche hypervolumes to serve as proxies for diet and production use patterns of L. chamaeleonticeps and C. microps. We hypothesized that: (a) species exhibit ontogenetic shifts in diet and use of production sources; (b) species acquire energy from spatially distinct resource pools that reflect a sedentary life-history and differential use of the continental shelf-edge; and (c) species exhibit differentiation in one or more measured niche axes. We found evidence for ontogenetic shifts in diet ({$\delta$}15N) but not production source ({$\delta$}13C) in both species, suggesting a subtle expansion of measured ecological niche axes. Spatial interpolation of stable isotope ratios showed distinct latitudinal gradients; for example, individuals were 13C enriched in northern and 15N enriched in southern regions, supporting the assertion that tilefish species acquire energy from regional resource pools. High isotopic overlap was observed among species ({$\geq$}82\%); however, when hypervolumes included depth and region of capture, overlap among species substantially decreased to overlap estimates of 15\%\textendash 77\%. This suggests that spatial segregation could alleviate potential competition for resources among tilefish species inhabiting continental shelf-edge environments. Importantly, our results question the consensus interpretation of isotopic overlap estimates as representative of direct competition among species for shared resources or habitats, instead identifying habitat segregation as a possible mechanism for coexistence of tilefish species in the NW Atlantic.},

While other deep-sea fishes possess pigmented filters and silver reflectors to match sunlight filtering down through the depths, myctophids developed a blue-green reflector for this purpose. In this study, we showed in a lanternfish Diaphus watasei that the reflector comprised monolayered iridophores containing multilayered guanine crystals which enable high reflection with light interference colouration. Platelets shape in body photophores is an unique near-regular hexagonal, probably to allow the homogeneity of reflection angle of the luminescence from photocytes. Focus point of the parabola-like reflector is positioned on the photocytes that ensures the light produced from the photocytes is redirected to the ventral direction. In~vitro luminescence reaction using purified luciferase and the substrate coelenterazine showed the light emission at {$\lambda$}max 454 nm, while reflection spectra of the iridophores exhibit peaks at longer wavelength, which accomplish to alter the luminescence emitted from photocytes to longer wavelength to fit the mesopelagic light environment. Taken together, we revealed multiple mechanistic elaborations in myctophid body photophores to achieve effective control of biochemical luminescence for counterillumination.},

We also examined the relationship between functional diversity of fish assemblages and indices of biotic integrity and habitat quality. Environmental characteristics at the local reach and catchment scales, including the extent of forested area in the watershed, amount of land developed for urban and agricultural uses, stream size, substrate characteristics, and availability of riffle and pool habitats, were significantly associated with functional trait composition of fish assemblages. Broad physiographic differences between ecoregions also had a large influence on taxonomic and functional assemblage structure. In general, the volume of functional trait space occupied by fish assemblages was greatest in streams with high habitat quality scores located within landscapes having less alteration from agriculture and urban development.

  abstract = {Functional diversity is an important component of biodiversity, yet in comparison to taxonomic diversity, methods of quantifying functional diversity are less well developed. Here, we propose a means for quantifying functional diversity that may be particularly useful for determining how functional diversity is related to ecosystem functioning. This measure of functional diversity ''FD'' is defined as the total branch length of a functional dendrogram. Various characteristics of FD make it preferable to other measures of functional diversity, such as the number of functional groups in a community. Simulating species' trait values illustrates how the relative importance of richness and composition for FD depends on the effective dimensionality of the trait space in which species separate. Fewer dimensions increase the importance of community composition and functional redundancy. More dimensions increase the importance of species richness and decreases functional redundancy. Clumping of species in trait space increases the relative importance of community composition. Five natural communities show remarkably similar relationships between FD and species richness.},

Ecological models are currently one of the strongest approaches used to predicting and understanding the consequences of anthropogenic and climate-driven changes in the natural environment. We assess the most commonly used capabilities of the modelling community to provide information about indicators outlined in the MSFD, particularly on biodiversity, food webs, non-indigenous species and seafloor integrity descriptors. We built a catalogue of models and their derived indicators to assess which models were able to demonstrate: (1) the linkages between indicators and ecosystem structure and function and (2) the impact of pressures on ecosystem state through indicators. Our survey identified 44 ecological models being implemented in Europe, with a high prevalence of those that focus on links between hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry, followed by end-to-end, species distribution/habitat suitability, bio-optical (remote sensing) and multispecies models. Approximately 200 indicators could be derived from these models, the majority of which were biomass and physical/hydrological/chemical indicators. Biodiversity and food webs descriptors, with {$\sim$}49\% and {$\sim$}43\% respectively, were better addressed in the reviewed modelling approaches than the non-indigenous species (0.3\%) and sea floor integrity ({$\sim$}8\%) descriptors. Out of 12 criteria and 21 MSFD indicators relevant to the abovementioned descriptors, currently only three indicators were not addressed by the 44 models reviewed. Modelling approaches showed also the potential to inform on the complex, integrative ecosystem dimensions while addressing ecosystem fundamental properties, such as interactions between structural components and ecosystems services provided, despite the fact that they are not part of the MSFD indicators set. The cataloguing of models and their derived indicators presented in this study, aim at helping the planning and integration of policies like the MSFD which require the assessment of all European Seas in relation to their ecosystem status and pressures associated and the establishment of environmental targets (through the use of indicators) to achieve GEnS by 2020.},

  abstract = {1 The need for sensitive biological measures of aquatic ecosystem integrity applicable at large spatial scales has been highlighted by the implementation of the European Water Framework Directive. Using fish communities as indicators of habitat quality in rivers, we developed a multi-metric index to test our capacity to (i) correctly model a variety of metrics based on assemblage structure and functions, and (ii) discriminate between the effects of natural vs. human-induced environmental variability at a continental scale. 2 Information was collected for 5252 sites distributed among 1843 European rivers. Data included variables on fish assemblage structure, local environmental variables, sampling strategy and a river basin classification based on native fish fauna similarities accounting for regional effects on local assemblage structure. Fifty-eight metrics reflecting different aspects of fish assemblage structure and function were selected from the available literature and tested for their potential to indicate habitat degradation. 3 To quantify possible deviation from a `reference condition' for any given site, we first established and validated statistical models describing metric responses to natural environmental variability in the absence of any significant human disturbance. We considered that the residual distributions of these models described the response range of each metric, whatever the natural environmental variability. After testing the sensitivity of these residuals to a gradient of human disturbance, we finally selected 10 metrics that were combined to obtain a European fish assemblage index. We demonstrated that (i) when considering only minimally disturbed sites the index remains invariant, regardless of environmental variability, and (ii) the index shows a significant negative linear response to a gradient of human disturbance. 4 Synthesis and applications. In this reference condition modelling approach, by including a more complete description of environmental variability at both local and regional scales it was possible to develop a novel fish biotic index transferable between catchments at the European scale. The use of functional metrics based on biological attributes of species instead of metrics based on species themselves reduced the index sensitivity to the variability of fish fauna across different biogeographical areas.},

  abstract = {Trophic interactions in the deep-sea fish community of the Galicia Bank seamount (NE Atlantic) were inferred by using stomach contents analyses (SCA) and stable isotope analyses (SIA) of 27 fish species and their main prey items. Samples were collected during three surveys performed in 2009, 2010 and 2011 between 625 and 1800m depth. Three main trophic guilds were determined using SCA data: pelagic, benthopelagic and benthic feeders, respectively. Vertically migrating macrozooplankton and meso-bathypelagic shrimps were identified to play a key role as pelagic prey for the deep sea fish community of the Galicia Bank. Habitat overlap was hardly detected; as a matter of fact, when species coexisted most of them evidenced a low dietary overlap, indicating a high degree of resource partitioning. A high potential competition, however, was observed among benthopelagic feeders, i.e.: Etmopterus spinax, Hoplostethus mediterraneus and Epigonus telescopus. A significant correlation was found between {$\delta$}15N and {$\delta$}13C for all the analysed species. When calculating Trophic Levels (TLs) for the main fish species, using both the SCA and SIA approaches, some discrepancies arose: TLs calculated from SIA were significantly higher than those obtained from SCA, probably indicating a higher consumption of benthic-suprabenthic prey in the previous months. During the summer, food web functioning in the Galicia Bank was more influenced by the assemblages dwelling in the water column than by deep-sea benthos, which was rather scarce in the summer samples. These discrepancies demonstrate the importance of using both approaches, SCA (snapshot of diet) and SIA (assimilated food in previous months), when attempting trophic studies, if an overview of food web dynamics in different compartments of the ecosystem is to be obtained.},

  abstract = {It is well known that predators can induce morphological changes in some fish: individuals exposed to predation cues increase body depth and the length of spines. We hypothesize that these structures may evolve synergistically, as together, these traits will further enlarge the body dimensions of the fish that gape-limited predators must overcome. We therefore expect that the orientation of the spines will predict which body dimension increases in the presence of predators. Using phylogenetic comparative methods, we tested this prediction on the macroevolutionary scale across 347 teleost families, which display considerable variation in fin spines, body depth and width. Consistent with our predictions, we demonstrate that fin spines on the vertical plane (dorsal and anal fins) are associated with a deeper-bodied optimum. Lineages with spines on the horizontal plane (pectoral fins) are associated with a wider-bodied optimum. Optimal body dimensions across lineages without spines paralleling the body dimension match the allometric expectation. Additionally, lineages with longer spines have deeper and wider body dimensions. This evolutionary relationship between fin spines and body dimensions across teleosts reveals functional synergy between these two traits and a potential macroevolutionary signature of predation on the evolutionary dynamics of body shape.},

Evidence obtained by utilizing a variety of photo-optical devices, providing spatial, temporal, and spectral information, has demonstrated that this portion of the Earth is a region rich in life and light. Findings to date have provided challenges for geologists, physicists, biologists, chemists, and oceanographers, and the sharing of techniques and expertise among these disciplines has demonstrated the rewards to be gained from interdisciplinary research. Bioluminescence has been found far below the depths at which it has received most attention historically. The study of this phenomenon is complicated by the fact that the measuring apparatus itself causes a stimulation of the luminescence so that a true background will be difficult to determine. Nuclear physics has played a role in that the electron resulting from the decay of an isotope of potassium (K40) provides an ubiquitous background of light through a process known as Cerenkov radiation. The possibility of light generated by cosmic rays must also be taken into account. An intriguing source of light at the very bottom of the sea is found at hydrothermal vents. Here are found not only light but also abundant life. At the vent orifice, temperatures are found to be as high as 250\textdegree\textendash 400\textdegree C. A large component of the light is due to thermal radiation. However, the light in the wavelengths 450\textendash 600 nm is significantly greater than the thermal flux at those wavelengths. Identifying the physical mechanisms that may account for this excess is important in providing insight into the processes occurring in the vents and plumes and in the accompanying ecosystem.},

Mean {$\delta$}15N values of the predators ranged from 9.18 to 11.13 \textperthousand, resulting in trophic position estimates between the third and fourth trophic level, although significant shifts in {$\delta$}15N with increasing body size suggest that some of these species undergo ontogenetic shifts in trophic position. Bayesian standard ellipses, used to estimate isotopic niche areas, differed in size among species, with those occupying the highest relative trophic positions possessing the largest isotopic niches.

Among these, the 'community-weighted mean trait value' (CWM) and the Rao coefficient have been widely used in ecological research for summarizing different facets of functional composition and diversity. Analyzing changes in functional diversity of bee communities along a post-fire successional gradient in southern Switzerland we show that these two measures may be used to describe two complementary aspects of community structure, such as the mean and the dispersion of functional traits within a given species assemblage. While CWM can be adequately used to summarize shifts in mean trait values within communities due to environmental selection for certain functional traits, the Rao coefficient can be effectively applied to analyze patterns of trait convergence or divergence compared to a random expectation.},

  abstract = {Submarine canyons are often morphologically complex features in the deep sea contributing to habitat heterogeneity. In addition, they act as major conduits of organic matter from the shallow productive shelf to the food deprived deep-sea, promoting gradients in food resources and areas of sediment resuspension and deposition. This study focuses on the Baltimore and Norfolk canyons, in the western North Atlantic Ocean, and investigates how different biogeochemical drivers influence canyon and slope macrofaunal communities. Replicated sediment cores were collected along the main axes (\textasciitilde 180\textendash 1200~m) of Baltimore and Norfolk canyons and at comparable depths on the adjacent slopes. Cores were sorted, assessing whole community macrofaunal ({$>$}300~{$\mu$}m) abundance, diversity and standing stocks. Canyon communities were significantly different from slope communities in terms of diversity, abundance patterns and community assemblages, which were attributed to high levels of organic matter enrichment within canyons. There was a significant departure from the expected density-depth relationship in both canyons, driven by enhanced abundances between 800 and 900~m canyon depths, which was characterised as a deposition zone for organic matter. Bathymetric zonation, sediment dynamics, organic enrichment, and disturbance events were clear factors that structured the benthic communities in both Baltimore and Norfolk canyons. Coupling family-level community data, with sediment grain-size and biogeochemistry data explained community dynamics across depth and biogeochemical gradients, providing further evidence that canyons disrupt macrofaunal diversity and density patterns in the deep-sea benthos.},

  abstract = {The deep-sea is the largest biome of the biosphere, and contains more than half of the whole ocean's microbes. Uncovering their general patterns of diversity and community structure at a global scale remains a great challenge, as only fragmentary information of deep-sea microbial diversity exists based on regional-scale studies. Here we report the first globally comprehensive survey of the prokaryotic communities inhabiting the bathypelagic ocean using high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. This work identifies the dominant prokaryotes in the pelagic deep ocean and reveals that 50\% of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) belong to previously unknown prokaryotic taxa, most of which are rare and appear in just a few samples. We show that whereas the local richness of communities is comparable to that observed in previous regional studies, the global pool of prokaryotic taxa detected is modest (\textasciitilde 3600 OTUs), as a high proportion of OTUs are shared among samples. The water masses appear to act as clear drivers of the geographical distribution of both particle-attached and free-living prokaryotes. In addition, we show that the deep-oceanic basins in which the bathypelagic realm is divided contain different particle-attached (but not free-living) microbial communities. The combination of the aging of the water masses and a lack of complete dispersal are identified as the main drivers for this biogeographical pattern. All together, we identify the potential of the deep ocean as a reservoir of still unknown biological diversity with a higher degree of spatial complexity than hitherto considered.},

  abstract = {This analysis deals with size variations in the breeding territories of land birds which obtain most or all of their food on the territory. For the species studied as a whole, territory size shows a strong positive relationship to body weight. Predators tend to have larger territories than omnivores or herbivores of the same weight, presumably due to the relatively denser food of the latter species. The home ranges of raptors inhabiting two areas were found to be significantly correlated with an index of the numerical density of their prey and in one area with raptor weight. Higher clutch size is not significantly associated with larger territories in any category of birds tested. The number of individuals defending the territory and the number feeding the young are probably not correlated with territory size. The exponential relationships between body weight of the consumer and three dependent variables\textendash food biomass consumed per unit time, average prey weight and territory or home range size\textendash are used to derive three predictions: a) Heavier predators take fewer individuals per unit time than lighter species; b) If certain restrictions are satisfied, the collective biomasses in a given large area increase as individual biomasses become larger for omnivorous species and decrease as individual biomasses increase for predators; c) For predators, the density of acceptable and accessible food in biomass per unit area decreases as the weight of the consumer increases. Territory or home range size increases more rapidly with body weight for predators than for omnivores or herbivores. This relationship holds true for both birds and mammals and presumably reflects a rapidly decreasing food density for predators of increasing weight. Since smaller predators do not feed over a wider range of food size than larger species, and since there are less species or individuals feeding on large food than on small, the predators of the areas studied probably consume food whose distribution of biomass with food size is declining. The habit of feeding on exclusive areas is considerably more widespread among predators than among omnivores and herbivores. The smaller spatial needs for omnivorous and herbivorous birds of a given biomass and perhaps the greater patchiness of their food when compared to predators are used to explain the higher occurrence of gregarious nesting in the former group. Implications of this study for the functions of feeding territories maintained during the breeding season are discussed.},

This is especially true among species com-prising freshwater ichthyofaunas on small oceanic islands, where fishes frequently traverse bound-aries between different ecosystems. Many aspects of functional performance in fishes relate directly to morphological features and limitations. In this review, we use the ichthyofauna of the Hawaiian Islands as an example to demonstrate how the habits, habitat, and in-stream distribution of five amphi-dromous fish species relate to the functional morphology of locomotion and feeding. Furthermore, we evaluate how performance limitations related to functional morphology might affect each species under changing environmental conditions. Based on this analysis we make four key recommenda-tions. (1) Hawaiian stream management plans need to be tailored to island-specific conditions. (2) Estuaries need to be studied as a critical habitat because of the interface between fishes and human populations in these areas. (3) New recruits of Sicyopterus stimpsoni might serve as a key indicator species to monitor long-term health of Hawaiian estuaries. (4) The broad use of the Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) to assess Hawaiian stream health needs to be critically evaluated.},

Data were collected in the Bari Canyon and in an adjacent area on the continental slope during an experimental longline survey carried out in June 2015. A total of 19 fish species were collected (16 inside and 13 outside the canyon). Differences between the sites were evaluated by means of a set of univariate and multivariate methods (analysis of variance, permutational multivariate analysis of variance, non-metric multidimensional scaling). The abundance and biomass of the whole catch were significantly greater inside than outside the canyon. The most abundant species were the shark Galeus melastomus and the teleost fishes Conger conger, Helicolenus dactylopterus, Merluccius merluccius, Pagellus bogaraveo and Phycis blennoides. All these species were found to be more abundant in the canyon than in the adjacent area. However, a significantly greater abundance inside the canyon than outside was detected for C. conger, while P. blennoides showed both significantly greater abundance and biomass in the canyon than outside. P. bogaraveo was exclusively caught inside the canyon. C. conger and P. blennoides exhibited significant differences in their sizes between the canyon and the adjacent area: a greater number of both smaller and larger individuals were found in the canyon than on the open slope. Mature females and males were mostly observed in the canyon in all the most abundant species, with the exception of P. blennoides due to its autumn-winter spawning. The present study corroborates the role of the Bari Canyon as a refuge area and an Essential Fish Habitat for fish species exploited in the neighbouring fishing grounds, highlighting the need for conservation measures.},

Answering this question would help predict a predator's diet and improve our understanding of how an ecosystem functions. The aim of this study was to test if the diet of common dolphins, Delphinus delphis, in the oceanic Bay of Biscay reflected prey availability or a selection shaped by prey energy densities (ED). To do this, the community of potential prey species, described both in terms of relative abundance and energy densities, was compared to the common dolphin diet in this area. This analysis of a predator's diet and its prey field revealed that the common dolphin selected its diet on the basis of prey energy densities (significant values of Chesson's index for ED{$>$}5kJg-1). High-energy prey were positively selected in the diet [e.g. Notoscopelus kroeyeri, ED=7.9kJg-1, 9\% of relative abundance in the environment (\%Ne); 62\% of relative abundance in the diet (\%Nd)] and low-energy prey disregarded (Xenodermichthys copei, ED=2.1kJg-1, 20\%Ne, 0\%Nd). These results supported the hypothesis that common dolphins selected high energy density prey species to meet their energetically expensive life style and disregard prey organisms of poor energy content even when abundant in the environment.},

Enhanced understanding of the functional relationships between predators and their prey is now essential to go beyond the traditional taxonomic framework of dietary studies and to improve our knowledge of ecosystem functioning for wildlife conservation and management. We test the relevance of a three-matrix approach in foraging ecology among a marine mammal community in the northeast Atlantic to identify the key functional traits shaping prey selection processes regardless of the taxonomy of both the predators and prey. Our study reveals that prey found in the diet of marine mammals possess functional traits which are directly and significantly linked to predator characteristics, allowing the establishment of a functional typology of marine mammal\textendash prey relationships. We found prey selection of marine mammals was primarily shaped by physiological and morphological traits of both predators and prey, confirming that energetic costs of foraging strategies and muscular performance are major drivers of prey selection in marine mammals. We demonstrate that trait-based approaches can provide a new definition of the resource needs of predators. This framework can be used to anticipate bottom-up effects on marine predator population dynamics and to identify predators which are sensitive to the loss of key prey functional traits when prey availability is reduced.},

The middle slope assemblage is characterized by much higher values in some ecological parameters such biomass and mean fish weight, resulting from the dominance of middle to large size species (e.g. Alepocephalus rostratus, Trachyrhynchus trachyrhynchus, Mora mom). On the upper slope two different stations were considered, one inside and the other outside a submarine canyon. Only slight differences were found in species composition, and hence sample and species were not clearly separated by a correspondence analysis. However, some interesting ecological differences exist between these two stations. Much higher values in abundance and biomass inside the canyon were indicative of higher food availability there. Moreover, a drop in mean fish weight was also noted inside the canyon. The analysis of size distributions in the commonest species along the upper slope showed that the submarine canyon acts as a recruiting ground for some of them.},

Exploration of methods to impute missing data in PV systems is lacking. This paper conducts statistical analyses to understand missingness mechanism in data of a real grid-tied 1.4MW PV system at Miami, and compares the imputation performance of different methods: random imputation, multiple imputation using expectation-maximization, kNN, and random forests, using error metrics and size effect measures. Imputed values are used in a multilayer perceptron to predict and compare PV generation with observed values. Results show that values imputed using kNN and random forests have the least differences in proportions and help utilities make more accurate prediction of generation for distribution planning.},

The 100th anniversary of the British Ecological Society in 2013 is an opportune moment to reflect on the current status of ecology as a science and look forward to high-light priorities for future work. To do this, we identified 100 important questions of fundamental importance in pure ecology. We elicited questions from ecologists working across a wide range of systems and disciplines. The 754 questions submitted (listed in the online appendix) from 388 participants were narrowed down to the final 100 through a process of discussion, rewording and repeated rounds of voting. This was done during a two-day workshop and thereafter. The questions reflect many of the important current conceptual and technical pre-occupations of ecology. For example, many questions concerned the dynamics of environmental change and complex ecosystem interactions, as well as the interaction between ecology and evolution. The questions reveal a dynamic science with novel subfields emerging. For example, a group of questions was dedicated to disease and micro-organisms and another on human impacts and global change reflecting the emergence of new subdisciplines that would not have been foreseen a few decades ago. The list also contained a number of questions that have perplexed ecologists for decades and are still seen as crucial to answer, such as the link between population dynamics and life-history evolution. Synthesis. These 100 questions identified reflect the state of ecology today. Using them as an agenda for further research would lead to a substantial enhancement in understanding of the discipline, with practical relevance for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem function.},

  abstract = {The trophic ecology of the stomiid assemblage (Pisces, Stomiiformes, Stomiidae) in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, a region with physical and biological characteristics typical of oligotrophic low-latitude regimes, was investigated. Over 1400 specimens representing 69 species and 17 genera were examined. Four patterns of feeding were evident among the abundant stomiids: (1) myctophid predation; (2) zooplankton/small micronekton predation; (3) penaeidean shrimp predation; and (4) copepod/micronekton predation. One rare species preyed on cephalopods. Il was concluded that stomiids exhibited a high level of prey-selectivity, particularly considering the broad range of prey types available in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. The absence of numerically dominant potential prey (e.g.Cyclothone spp., sternoptychids) in the diets of piscivorous stomiids is possibly a function of feeding periodicity coupled with stomiid vertical migration. Stomiids may feed at night in the upper 200 m on vertically migrating myctophids while disregarding co-occurring nonmigrating prey during the daytime. Integration of stomiid abundance and diet data suggests that: (1) stomiids are the dominant upper trophic-level predators of the Gulf of Mexico mesopelagial, (2) stomiids inflict the highest predation impact on myctophids in low-latitude midwater ecosystems, and (3) the historic use of predation-avoidance arguments to explain certain mesopelagic phenomena (e.g. vertical migration, ventral photophores) appears to be substantiated by estimates of stomiid predation-impact. The stomiids may serve as key trophic mediators in the transfer of energy from the mesopelagial to the bathyand benthopelagial.},

The Challenger Deep assemblages are dominated by these phylogenetically important forms. Molecular evidence suggests that similar taxa are modern representatives of the basal foraminiferal evolutionary radiation that probably occurred in the Precambrian (Neoproterozoic).

To examine niche differences, we must first characterize how species occupy niche space, and two approaches are commonly used in the ecological literature. The first uses species traits to estimate multivariate trait space (so-called functional trait diversity, FD); the second quantifies the amount of time or evolutionary history captured by a group of species (phylogenetic diversity, PD). It is often\textemdash but controversially\textemdash assumed that these putative measures of niche space are at a minimum correlated and perhaps redundant, since more evolutionary time allows for greater accumulation of trait changes. This theoretical expectation remains surprisingly poorly evaluated, particularly in the context of multivariate measures of trait diversity. We evaluated the relationship between phylogenetic diversity and trait diversity using analytical and simulation-based methods across common models of trait evolution. We show that PD correlates with FD increasingly strongly as more traits are included in the FD measure. Our results indicate that phylogenetic diversity can be a useful surrogate for high-dimensional trait diversity, but we also show that the correlation weakens when the underlying process of trait evolution includes variation in rate and optima.},

Five of the most promising approaches to investigate the behavioral ecology are reviewed: (1) functional morphology, (2) field sampling, (3) acoustic tracking, (4) in-situ surveillance, and (5) ex-situ experimentation. Functional morphology, often a ``by-product'' of taxonomic and systematic studies, is strongly comparative and correlative, and serves to examine hypotheses on behavioral strategies. Field sampling with towed gear identifies vertical and horizontal distribution in the water column and deployments of stationary gear document aggregation and diversity patterns on or close to the seafloor. With acoustic instruments vertical migrations and segregation patterns can be tracked. In-situ observations with cameras and attraction devices or from underwater vehicles focus studies on behavior and habitat selection over small to large-scale intervals and distances, both vertically and horizontally. Ex-situ behavioral studies of deep-sea fishes brought to the surface have been conducted to a limited extent, mainly in unpressurized aquaria. An integrated approach which combines various methods would provide a more complete understanding of behavioral diversity and adaptations to environmental factors.},

  abstract = {The topographical and hydrological complexity of submarine canyons, coupled with high substratum heterogeneity, make them ideal environments for cold-water coral (CWC) habitats. These habitats, including reefs, are thought to provide important functions for many organisms. The canyons incising the continental slope of the Bay of Biscay have distinct morphological differences from the north to the south. CWCs have been reported from this basin in the late 19th century; however, little is known about their present-day distribution, diversity and environmental drivers in the canyons. In this study, the characteristics and distribution of CWC habitats in the submarine canyons of the Bay of Biscay are investigated. Twenty-four canyons and three locations between adjacent canyons were sampled using a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) or a towed camera system. Acquired images were annotated for habitat type (using the CoralFISH classification system), substrate cover and coral identification. Furthermore, the influence of hydrological factors and geomorphology on the CWC distribution was investigated. Eleven coral habitats, formed by 62 morphotypes of scleractinians, gorgonians, antipatharians and seapens, inhabiting hard and/or soft substrate, were observed. The distribution patterns were heterogenous at regional and local scales; the south Bay of Biscay and the southeastern flank favored soft substrate habitats. Biogenic and hard substrate habitats supported higher coral diversities than soft substrate habitats and had similar species compositions. A higher coral species turnover characterized soft substrate habitats. Substrate type was the most important driver of the patterns in both distribution and composition. Observations of coral reefs on steeper areas in the canyons and coral rubble on flatter areas on the interfluve/upper slope, support the hypothesis that canyons serve as refuges, being less accessible to trawling, although natural causes may also contribute to the explanation of this distribution pattern. The results of this study fed into a proposal of a Natura 2000 network in the Bay of Biscay where management plans are rare.},

Median predictive performance for new species in target regions was 0.65 (area under receiver operating curve) and 1.24 times random (area under precision recall curve). Prediction in target regions did not worsen with increasing geographic, environmental or community compositional distance from the reference region, and was improved with reliable trait\textendash environment relationships. Transfer testing also identified trait\textendash environment relationships that did not transfer. These results give confidence that traits and transfer testing can assist in the hard problem of predicting environmental responses for new species, environmental conditions and regions.},

  abstract = {Imaging techniques are increasingly used in ecology studies, producing vast quantities of data. Inferring functional traits from individual images can provide original insights on ecosystem processes. Morphological traits are, as other functional traits, individual characteristics influencing an organism's fitness. We measured them from in situ image data to study an Arctic zooplankton community during sea ice break-up. Morphological descriptors (e.g., area, lightness, complexity) were automatically measured on {$\sim$} 28,000 individual copepod images from a high-resolution underwater camera deployed at more than 150 sampling sites across the ice-edge. A statistically-defined morphological space allowed synthesizing morphological information into interpretable and continuous traits (size, opacity, and appendages visibility). This novel approach provides theoretical and methodological advantages because it gives access to both inter- and intra-specific variability by automatically analyzing a large dataset of individual images. The spatial distribution of morphological traits revealed that large copepods are associated with ice-covered waters, while open waters host smaller individuals. In those ice-free waters, copepods also seem to feed more actively, as suggested by the increased visibility of their appendages. These traits distributions are likely explained by bottom-up control: high phytoplankton concentrations in the well-lit open waters encourages individuals to actively feed and stimulates the development of small copepod stages. Furthermore, copepods located at the ice edge were opaquer, presumably because of full guts or an increase in red pigmentation. Our morphological trait-based approach revealed ecological patterns that would have been inaccessible otherwise, including color and posture variations of copepods associated with ice-edge environments in Arctic ecosystems.},

We demonstrate that, after controlling for increases in taxonomic diversity, functional richness increased incrementally between each time interval with benthic taxa filling progressively more functional space, combined with a significant functional dissimilarity between periods. The modern benthic biota functionally overlaps with fossil biotas but some modern taxa, especially large predators, have new trait combinations that may allow more functions to be performed. From a methodological perspective, these results illustrate the benefits of using multidimensional instead of lower dimensional functional frameworks when studying changes in functional diversity over space and time.},

  abstract = {In its simplest definition, a trait is a surrogate of organismal performance, and this meaning of the term has been used by evolutionists for a long time. Over the last three decades, developments in community and ecosystem ecology have forced the concept of trait beyond these original boundaries, and trait-based approaches are now widely used in studies ranging from the level of organisms to that of ecosystems. Despite some attempts to fix the terminology, especially in plant ecology, there is currently a high degree of confusion in the use, not only of the term ``trait'' itself, but also in the underlying concepts it refers to. We therefore give an unambiguous definition of plant trait, with a particular emphasis on functional trait. A hierarchical perspective is proposed, extending the ``performance paradigm'' to plant ecology. ``Functional traits'' are defined as morpho-physio-phenological traits which impact fitness indirectly via their effects on growth, reproduction and survival, the three components of individual performance. We finally present an integrative framework explaining how changes in trait values due to environmental variations are translated into organismal performance, and how these changes may influence processes at higher organizational levels. We argue that this can be achieved by developing ``integration functions'' which can be grouped into functional response (community level) and effect (ecosystem level) algorithms.},

We explore the utility of fish body size, mouth gape and jaw-lever mechanics in predicting patterns of prey use in two very different communities of fishes, Caribbean coral reef fishes, and species of the Centrarchidae that live in Lake Opinicon, Ontario. In spite of major differences in the spectrum of potential prey available, the centrarchids of Lake Opinicon show dietary transitions during ontogeny that are very similar to those seen among and within species of Caribbean groupers (Serranidae). The transition from small zooplankton to intermediate sized invertebrates and ultimately to fishes appears to be very general in ram-suction feeding fishes and is probably driven largely by the constraints of mouth size on prey capture ability. The jaw-lever systems for mouth opening and closing represent direct trade-offs for speed and force of jaw movement. The ratio of in-lever to out-lever in the opening system changes during ontogeny in bluegill, indicating that the mechanics and kinematics of jaw movement may change as well. Among 34 species of Caribbean reef fishes, biting species had jaw-closing ratios that favored force translation, while species that employ rapid-strike ram-suction had closing ratios that enhanced speed of closing and mouth opening ratios that favored a more rapid expansion of the mouth during the strike. We suggest that when prey are categorized into functional groups, reflecting the specific performance features that are important in capturing and handling them, and the differences among habitats in the available prey resource are taken into account, general patterns can be found in morphology-diet relations that cross phylogenetic boundaries.},

  abstract = {The deep sea is the largest habitat on earth. Its three great faunal environments \textendash{} the twilight mesopelagic zone, the dark bathypelagic zone and the vast flat expanses of the benthic habitat \textendash{} are home to a rich fauna of vertebrates and invertebrates. In the mesopelagic zone (150\textendash 1000 m), the down-welling daylight creates an extended scene that becomes increasingly dimmer and bluer with depth. The available daylight also originates increasingly from vertically above, and bioluminescent point-source flashes, well contrasted against the dim background daylight, become increasingly visible. In the bathypelagic zone below 1000 m no daylight remains, and the scene becomes entirely dominated by point-like bioluminescence. This changing nature of visual scenes with depth \textendash{} from extended source to point source \textendash{} has had a profound effect on the designs of deep-sea eyes, both optically and neurally, a fact that until recently was not fully appreciated. Recent measurements of the sensitivity and spatial resolution of deep-sea eyes \textendash{} particularly from the camera eyes of fishes and cephalopods and the compound eyes of crustaceans \textendash{} reveal that ocular designs are well matched to the nature of the visual scene at any given depth. This match between eye design and visual scene is the subject of this review. The greatest variation in eye design is found in the mesopelagic zone, where dim down-welling daylight and bioluminescent point sources may be visible simultaneously. Some mesopelagic eyes rely on spatial and temporal summation to increase sensitivity to a dim extended scene, while others sacrifice this sensitivity to localise pinpoints of bright bioluminescence. Yet other eyes have retinal regions separately specialised for each type of light. In the bathypelagic zone, eyes generally get smaller and therefore less sensitive to point sources with increasing depth. In fishes, this insensitivity, combined with surprisingly high spatial resolution, is very well adapted to the detection and localisation of point-source bioluminescence at ecologically meaningful distances. At all depths, the eyes of animals active on and over the nutrient-rich sea floor are generally larger than the eyes of pelagic species. In fishes, the retinal ganglion cells are also frequently arranged in a horizontal visual streak, an adaptation for viewing the wide flat horizon of the sea floor, and all animals living there. These and many other aspects of light and vision in the deep sea are reviewed in support of the following conclusion: it is not only the intensity of light at different depths, but also its distribution in space, which has been a major force in the evolution of deep-sea vision.},

  abstract = {Background Understanding the distribution of marine biodiversity is a crucial first step towards the effective and sustainable management of marine ecosystems. Recent efforts to collate location records from marine surveys enable us to assemble a global picture of recorded marine biodiversity. They also effectively highlight gaps in our knowledge of particular marine regions. In particular, the deep pelagic ocean \textendash{} the largest biome on Earth \textendash{} is chronically under-represented in global databases of marine biodiversity. Methodology/Principal Findings We use data from the Ocean Biogeographic Information System to plot the position in the water column of ca 7 million records of marine species occurrences. Records from relatively shallow waters dominate this global picture of recorded marine biodiversity. In addition, standardising the number of records from regions of the ocean differing in depth reveals that regardless of ocean depth, most records come either from surface waters or the sea bed. Midwater biodiversity is drastically under-represented. Conclusions/Significance The deep pelagic ocean is the largest habitat by volume on Earth, yet it remains biodiversity's big wet secret, as it is hugely under-represented in global databases of marine biological records. Given both its value in the provision of a range of ecosystem services, and its vulnerability to threats including overfishing and climate change, there is a pressing need to increase our knowledge of Earth's largest ecosystem.},

  pages = {14},
  abstract = {In the present paper, an attempt is made to investigate whether the body shape indices can be used to predict food habits of fish species in three reservoir fish communities of Sri Lanka. The present analysis is based on the studies on food and feeding habits of fish species and their body shape indices in three Sri Lankan reservoirs, namely Minneriya, Udawalawe and Victoria. Body proportions of individual fish species were determined as P1 (= Maximum height of the body/ Maximum width of the body) and P2 (= Total length/ Maximum height of the body), which were found to be negative curvilinearly related. Trophic indices (Ti) of individual fish species were determined on the basis of trophic level of each food item and the fractions of all food items consumed by fish species, which ranged from 1 for exclusively herbivorous species to 3 for carnivorous species. A negative logarithmic relationship between P1 and Ti indicates that laterally compressed fish species with deep bodies feed on lower trophic levels in the food web. On the other hand, dorso-ventrally flattened species with low P1 have higher trophic indices than those with high P1. The positive logarithmic relationship between P2 and Ti also indicates that short, deep-bodied fish species representing low P2 values feed on lower trophic levels whereas slender, long-bodied species with high P2 values feed on higher trophic levels. The body shapes, measured as simple body proportions of the definitions of P1 and P2, can therefore be used to predict feeding habits of fish.},

  abstract = {Color polymorphisms offer unique opportunities for testing the role of ecological adaptation and natural selection in the origin of species. However, the ecological conditions that facilitate the coexistence and speciation of color morphs in nature remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the ecological mechanisms maintaining the color polymorphism in the arc-eye hawkfish (Paracirrhites arcatus), which consists of two common morphs (pink white-striped [PWS] and melanistic [MEL]) and less common intermediates that all coexist on shallow coral reefs throughout the Indo-Pacific. Our approach was to test whether ecologically based disruptive selection on color could explain the maintenance of and possible incipient divergence between sympatric color morphs. We compared patterns of spatial distribution, abundance, habitat use and preference, and niche overlap among color morphs at nine sites along the leeward coast of Hawaii Island. We demonstrate that despite co-occurring at all sites, sympatric color morphs show significant niche divergence along a steep ecological gradient. Morph frequencies correlate strongly with a multivariate gradient in coral community and reef topography, which explained 81\% of the variability in relative abundance of the two main color morphs. Melanistic morphs were more frequent in shallow, steep surge zones dominated by Pocillopora corals. In contrast, PWS morphs were more frequent in deeper, sub-surge zones with higher coral cover dominated by Porites corals. Niche overlap analyses highlight how the two main morphs are partitioned on opposite ends of this continuous ecological gradient, while phenotypic intermediates are mostly restricted to intermediate habitats. The strong correlation between phenotype and environment suggests that morphs have fitness advantages in their respective habitats. We speculate that disruptive natural selection on color pattern to increase crypsis in heterogeneous visual environments has led to divergence in habitat preferences. The resulting ecological isolation provides a plausible mechanism for the persistence of multiple coexisting color phenotypes in P. arcatus. If divergence in color also affects mate choice, the evolution of reproductive isolation is likely to be promoted.},

  abstract = {Ecology is often said to lack general theories sufficiently predictive for applications. Here, we examine the concept of a periodic table of niches and feasibility of niche classification schemes from functional trait and performance data. Niche differences and their influence on ecological patterns and processes could be revealed effectively by first performing data reduction/ordination analyses separately on matrices of trait and performance data compiled according to logical associations with five basic niche 'dimensions', or aspects: habitat, life history, trophic, defence and metabolic. Resultant patterns then are integrated to produce interpretable niche gradients, ordinations and classifications. Degree of scheme periodicity would depend on degrees of niche conservatism and convergence causing species clustering across multiple niche dimensions. We analysed a sample data set containing trait and performance data to contrast two approaches for producing niche schemes: species ordination within niche gradient space, and niche categorisation according to trait-value thresholds. Creation of niche schemes useful for advancing ecological knowledge and its applications will depend on research that produces functional trait and performance datasets directly related to niche dimensions along with criteria for data standardisation and quality. As larger databases are compiled, opportunities will emerge to explore new methods for data reduction, ordination and classification. \textcopyright{} 2015 The Authors.

Here, we assess the importance of prey depletion as a driver of large carnivore endangerment globally using lists of prey species for each large carnivore compiled from the literature. We consider spatial variation in prey endangerment, changes in endangerment over time and the causes of prey depletion, finding considerable evidence that loss of prey base is a major and wide-ranging threat among large carnivore species. In particular, the clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa), Sunda clouded leopard (Neofelis diardi), tiger (Panthera tigris), dhole (Cuon alpinus) and Ethiopian wolf (Canis simensis) all have at least 40\% of their prey classified as threatened on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List and, along with the leopard (Panethra pardus), all of these species except the Ethiopian wolf have at least 50\% of their prey classified as declining. Of the 494 prey species in our analysis, an average of just 6.9\% of their ranges overlap protected areas. Together these results show the importance of a holistic approach to conservation that involves protecting both large carnivores directly and the prey upon which they depend.},

To deal with heterogeneous (i.e., mixed-attributes) data, we propose a novel kNN (k nearest neighbor) imputation method to iteratively imputing missing data, named GkNN (gray kNN) imputation. GkNN selects k nearest neighbors for each missing datum via calculating the gray distance between the missing datum and all the training data rather than traditional distance metric methods, such as Euclidean distance. Such a distance metric can deal with both numerical and categorical attributes. For achieving the better effectiveness, GkNN regards all the imputed instances (i.e., the missing data been imputed) as observed data, which with complete instances (instances without missing values) together to iteratively impute other missing data. We experimentally evaluate the proposed approach, and demonstrate that the gray distance is much better than the Minkowski distance at both capturing the proximity relationship (or nearness) of two instances and dealing with mixed attributes. Moreover, experimental results also show that the GkNN algorithm is much more efficient than existent kNN imputation methods.},

In this study, we measured the distribution of functional traits in an entire population of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) to quantify the magnitude of intraspecific variability in functional traits and niche (size, position, and overlap) between age classes. Stable isotope analyses ({$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N) were also used to determine the association between individual trophic ecology and intraspecific functional trait variability. We observed that functional traits were highly variable within the population (mean coefficient variation: 15.62\% {$\pm$} 1.78\% SE) and predominantly different between age classes. In addition, functional and trophic niche overlap between age classes was extremely low. Differences in functional niche between age classes were associated with strong changes in trophic niche occurring during ontogeny while, within age classes, differences among individuals were likely driven by trophic specialization. Each age class filled only a small portion of the total functional niche of the population and age classes occupied distinct portions in the functional space, indicating the existence of ontogenetic specialists with different functional roles within the population. The high amplitude of intraspecific variability in functional traits and differences in functional niche position among individuals reported here supports the recent claims for an individual-based approach in functional ecology.},
