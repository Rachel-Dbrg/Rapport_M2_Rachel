  abstract = {Aim Concerns over how global change will influence species distributions, in conjunction with increased emphasis on understanding niche dynamics in evolutionary and community contexts, highlight the growing need for robust methods to quantify niche differences between or within taxa. We propose a statistical framework to describe and compare environmental niches from occurrence and spatial environmental data. Location Europe, North America and South America. Methods The framework applies kernel smoothers to densities of species occurrence in gridded environmental space to calculate metrics of niche overlap and test hypotheses regarding niche conservatism. We use this framework and simulated species with pre-defined distributions and amounts of niche overlap to evaluate several ordination and species distribution modelling techniques for quantifying niche overlap. We illustrate the approach with data on two well-studied invasive species. Results We show that niche overlap can be accurately detected with the framework when variables driving the distributions are known. The method is robust to known and previously undocumented biases related to the dependence of species occurrences on the frequency of environmental conditions that occur across geographical space. The use of a kernel smoother makes the process of moving from geographical space to multivariate environmental space independent of both sampling effort and arbitrary choice of resolution in environmental space. However, the use of ordination and species distribution model techniques for selecting, combining and weighting variables on which niche overlap is calculated provide contrasting results. Main conclusions The framework meets the increasing need for robust methods to quantify niche differences. It is appropriate for studying niche differences between species, subspecies or intra-specific lineages that differ in their geographical distributions. Alternatively, it can be used to measure the degree to which the environmental niche of a species or intra-specific lineage has changed over time.},

  abstract = {Ecologically distinct species - species with distinct trait combinations - are not directly prioritized in current conservation frameworks. The consequence of this blind spot means species with the most distinct ecological strategies might be lost. Here, we quantify ecological distinctiveness, based on six traits, for 10,960 bird and 5,278 mammal species, summarizing species-level ecological irreplaceability. We find that threatened birds and mammals are, on average, more ecologically distinct. Specific examples of ecologically distinct and highly threatened species are Great Indian Bustard, Amsterdam Albatross, Asian Elephant and Sumatran Rhinoceros. These species have potentially irreplaceable ecological roles and their loss could undermine the integrity of ecological processes and functions. Yet, we also identify ecologically distinct widespread generalists, such as Lesser Black-backed Gull and Wild Boar. These generalist species have distinct ecological strategies that allow them to thrive across multiple environments. Thus, we suggest that high ecological distinctiveness is associated with either high extinction risk or successful hyper-generalism. We also find that ecologically distinct species are generally charismatic (using a previous measure of public perceptions of charisma). We thus highlight a conservation opportunity: capitalizing on public preferences for charismatic species could provide support for the conservation of the most ecologically distinct birds and mammals. Overall, our prioritization framework supports the conservation of species with irreplaceable ecological strategies, complementing existing frameworks that target extinction risk and evolutionary distinctiveness.},

  abstract = {Investigating the drivers of fish assemblage trophic structure is a critical question, in order to better understand ecosystem functioning, predict the effects of perturbations and implement integrated management of exploited marine ecosystems. Ecosystemic surveys enabled the determination of the trophic structure of the fish assemblages in three French marine ecosystems, namely the Eastern English Channel, the Bay of Biscay and the Gulf of Lions, through the simultaneous collection of qualitative (stable isotopes and energy content) and quantitative (biomass) data. In the Bay of Biscay and in the Gulf of Lions, pelagic primary production supported at least 80\% of the fish biomass production, and explained the dominance of pelagic species, but with differences resulting from the different productivity. The lower productivity in the oligotrophic Gulf of Lions led to a lower total biomass, energy density as well as the predominance of zooplankton-feeders. In contrast, fluxes in the Bay of Biscay were sufficient to support a higher biomass of pelagic piscivores, and of species with higher energy content. In the shallow Eastern English Channel, the respective contributions of pelagic and benthic sources were similar. Bentho-demersal species of higher trophic level dominated this assemblage, because of their ability to exploit both pathways. Results of the present study confirmed that fisheries-focused surveys can be used as efficient platforms to address questions about ecosystem functioning. Here, it confirmed the expected differences between ecosystems and the importance of primary production and environment as drivers of fish assemblage structure and functioning. Future studies should nevertheless develop new methods to better assess the paramount role of low trophic level consumers.},

In this study, we provide a comprehensive description of the general morphology of the myctophid eye, based on analysis of 53 different species, to understand better their visual capabilities. Results confirm that myctophids possess several visual adaptations for dim-light conditions, including enlarged eyes, an aphakic gap, a tapetum lucidum, and a pure rod retina with high densities of long photoreceptors. Two novel retinal specializations were also discovered. The first specialization is a fundal pigmentation in adult eyes, found within an isolated retinal region (typically central retina) composed of modified pigment epithelial cells, which we hypothesize to be the remnant of a more pronounced visual specialization important in larval stages. The second specialization is an aggregation of extracellular microtubular-like structures found within the sclerad region of the inner nuclear layer of the retina. We hypothesize that the marked interspecific differences in the hypertrophy of these microtubular-like structures may be related to inherent differences in visual function. A general interspecific variability in other parts of the eye is also revealed and examined in this study. The contribution of both ecology and phylogeny to the evolution of ocular specializations and vision in dim light are discussed.},

  year = {2006},
  pages = {66},
  abstract = {A methodological approach based on fish ecomorphology was chosen to predict potential fish diet. This study tests a method used in earlier research on a marine ecosystem containing phylogenetically diverse organisms: the North Sea. Fish feeding morphology imposes constraints on feeding options. A bottom-up perspective was used to describe the demands that food makes on fish feeding morphology. A set of quantitative morphological variables were measured on fish and compared to the demands made by different food-categories. Common North Sea Gadiformes and Pleuronectiformes were analysed. The results of the measurements were used as a basis for predictions of potential diet. Five `morphotypes' were identified: Large-mouthed flatfish, smallmouthed flatfish, soles, ling/rockling/haddock and other Gadiformes. The predictions on diet were checked by stomach content data from literature. The main conclusions were that morphology differed significantly among fish species indicating detailed morphological adaptations to specific food types. Furthermore the utilization of fast, relatively large prey were predicted better than the utilization of slow or sessile prey that is well hidden, hard to crack or otherwise `tough to handle'. Also the method failed to clearly separate different food types within this group of fast/large prey. Moreover, no clear distinction in stomach contents were found between Large-mouthed flatfish (being predicted as eating mostly shrimp) and Gadiformes (being predicted as eating mostly fish) within the group of fast prey hunters. Overall predictions succeed in separating different feeding guilds, but in some cases do not succeed in distinguishing between species. Knowledge on feeding behaviour on slow and sedentary benthic prey is a limiting factor. Also limiting the usefulness of the study is the incomplete knowledge and/or implementation of this knowledge on the distribution of both benthic fish and benthic prey items.},

  abstract = {Species of the family Sternoptychidae (hatchetfishes) occur worldwide and play critical roles by sequestering carbon, recycling nutrients, and acting as a key trophic link between epipelagic primary consumers and higher trophic levels in marine ecosystems. Nevertheless, basic knowledge on their ecology is still lacking and their functional ecology remains understudied with respect to composition, organization, functions and environment interactions. Here we integrated comprehensive information collected in the western Tropical Atlantic on the diversity, abundance, distribution and trophic ecology of hatchetfishes, including physicochemical features of their habitats and extensive carbon and nitrogen stable isotope data on its main prey groups. On this basis we defined five functional groups of hatchetfishes with different diet preference, isotopic composition, and vertical abundance peaks and reveal a possible high resource partitioning. Additionally, these species might have a different feeding tie chronology. Hence, hatchetfishes segregate in different ecological groups responding differently to environmental constraints including oxygen concentration and presenting diverse functional roles. As deep-sea species that migrate to epipelagic waters, hatchetfishes may play a key role in the transfer of subsurface photoassimilated carbon to deeper waters, a pathway through which the effects of climate change at the surface are transferred to the deep ocean. Moreover, as consumers of gelatinous organisms, these species convert ``gelatinous energy'' into ``fish energy'' readily usable by higher trophic levels, including endangered and commercially important species. This is a crucial trophic relationship that has been historically underestimated due to methodology limitations (e.g., quickly digested gelatinous organisms were probably underestimated in previous studies, based solely on stomach contents). Considering in ecosystem models this trophic relationship, as well as the functional organization of hatchetfishes, is important to properly answer key ecological questions including resource use, carbon transportation, and influence of mesopelagic community in climate change process.},

In such a situation, we need to understand the nature of the change and to make predictions about the way in which it might affect systems of interest; often we may also wish to understand what might be done to mitigate the predicted effects. In ecology, we usually make such predictions (or forecasts) by making use of mathematical models that describe the system and projecting them into the future, under changed conditions. Approaches emphasizing the desirability of simple models with analytical tractability and those that use assumed causal relationships derived statistically from data currently dominate ecological modelling. Although such models are excellent at describing the way in which a system has behaved, they are poor at predicting its future state, especially in novel conditions. In order to address questions about the impact of environmental change, and to understand what, if any, action might be taken to ameliorate it, ecologists need to develop the ability to project models into novel, future conditions. This will require the development of models based on understanding the processes that result in a system behaving the way it does, rather than relying on a description of the system, as a whole, remaining valid indefinitely.},

  abstract = {Summary The swimming abilities of fishes are of vital importance to their ecology, and studies on fish swimming have been the focus of research for over a century. Here we explore the relationship between swimming ability and external body morphology, using data on Ucrit swimming speeds of 100 species of pre-settlement juvenile coral reef fishes (at the transition between the larval and adult habitats), comprising 26 different families from 5 orders. The taxonomic diversity of this methodologically consistent dataset provides a unique opportunity to examine the relationship between form and function in fish swimming across a broad taxonomic range. Overall, we found that a predictive model incorporating total length (TL), the square of caudal peduncle depth factor (CPDF2) and aspect ratio (AR) can be used to accurately predict swimming performance of a wide range of fish families, and was able to explain 69\% of the variability in swimming performance of these pre-settlement juvenile fishes. The model was also able to successfully predict the swimming speed of an outgroup salmonid species (Oncorhynchus mykiss). There was no evidence that the model fit differed among taxonomic groups, despite the inclusion of five different orders of fishes, suggesting that body morphology sufficiently explains the bulk of differences in swimming performance. Furthermore, the model appears to work equally well for fishes from the Great Barrier Reef and the Caribbean, and for families with different adult habitat associations and swimming modes. It remains to be determined how well the model predicts the swimming abilities of temperate species as well as adults of these same species. This model provides an invaluable means of predicting swimming abilities of pre-settlement juvenile fishes that are unable to be reared in the laboratory, do not perform well in swimming flumes or are unable to be captured live in the field.},

Yet the literature is inconsistent about the empirical correlation between functional traits and growth, casting doubt on the capacity of some prominent traits to influence growth rate. We propose that traits should influence growth in a way that depends on the size of individual plants. We outline mechanisms and hypotheses based on new theoretical work and test these predictions in tree species using a meta-analysis of 103 studies ({$>$} 500 correlations) for five traits (specific leaf area, wood density, maximum height, seed mass and maximum assimilation rate). We also recorded data for 14 other traits commonly used in the trait literature. To capture the effects of plant size, we tested for a shift in the direction of correlation between growth rates and each trait across three ontogenetic stages: seedling, sapling and adult. Results were consistent with predictions, although there were some limitations arising from unequal numbers of observation across ontogenetic stages. Specific leaf area was correlated with relative growth rate in seedlings but not in adult plants. Correlations of growth with wood density were not affected by ontogenetic stage. Seed mass, assimilation rate and maximum height were correlated with relative growth rate only in one ontogenetic stage category: seedlings, seedlings and adults, respectively. Although we were able to confirm several of our theoretical predictions, major knowledge gaps still exist in the trait literature. For example, for one-third of the traits considered, the majority ({$>$} 75\%) of reported correlations with growth came from the same ontogenetic stage. Synthesis. We show for some traits, how trait\textendash growth correlations change in a predictable way with plant size. Our understanding of plant strategies should shift away from describing species as having a fixed growth strategy throughout their life (on a continuous axis from slow to fast growth), in favour of a size-dependent growth trajectories.},

In the author's view, changes in the abilities of fish to maneuver in the water, to obtain food, and to force water over the gills\textemdash changes that are reflected in the morphology, particularly of skeletal elements\textemdash are among the most important advances that have been made within the teleostean group of fishes. With great skill and insight, Dr. Gosline develops these difficult concepts in the first section of the book. In working out his system of classification of teleosts, presented in the second section, the author's major effort was placed on clarifying the underlying zoological problems: he views the system primarily as a vehicle for discussing zoological information that suggests relationships between teleostean groups. Any student of zoology\textemdash not only ichthyologists\textemdash will welcome this original and thoughtful approach to problems of animal classification.},

A total of nine morphometric measurements (Total length, Standard length, Fork length, Body depth, Head Length, Pre-dorsal fin length, Pre-pelvic fin length, Pre-pectoral fin length, and Pre-anal fin length) and body weight were noted. Basic descriptive statistical analysis and correlation coefficient (r) were analysis with total length (independent variable) and other morphometric measurements (dependent variable). The result presented that except pre-pelvic fin with total length in (Labeo rohita and Cyprinus carpio) and pre-dorsal fin with total length in (Cirrhinus mrigala and Catla catla) others all morphometric dimensions are highly correlated with total length. Also the regression coefficient (b) was less than 3.0 which indicated that all other morphometric dimensions compared with total length shows negative allometric growth and the body weight with total length shows positive allometric growth in (Labeo rohita = 3.260), negative allometric growth in (Catla catla = 2.100 and Cyprinus carpio = 2.400) and isomeric growth in (Cirrhinus mrigala = 3.016).

Ecological experiments, observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in influencing ecosystem properties.

These species were first assigned to eight broad trophic guilds based on stomach contents analysis. The relationships between diet and morphology were then examined using Redundancy Analysis, after having checked for potential phylogenetical effects. Results show that, independently of any phylogenetic constraints, some of the trophic guilds could be grossly predicted from few relevant morphological attributes (i.e. relative intestinal length, standard length and mouth orientation) and thus suggest a significant link between diet and morphology. In other words, species having similar diet tend to converge to some extent on some morphological attributes. This link was nevertheless rather weak, suggesting that even if morphology may set limits to patterns of resource use, these limits are broad enough to allow fishes changing their choice of prey resources to respond to local biotic and/or abiotic conditions.},

Populations of these columbines are subject to complex patterns of divergent selection across environments, which partly explain the taxonomic structure of the group. This suggests the hypothesis that niche divergence must have occurred along the process of diversification of the group.We used MaxEnt to build environmental niche models of seven subspecies belonging to the three species of Aquilegia present in the Iberian Peninsula. From these models, we compared the environmental niches through two different approaches: ENMtools and multivariate methods.MaxEnt distributions conformed closely to the actual distribution of the study taxa. ENMtools methods failed to uncover any clear patterns of niche differentiation or conservatism in Iberian columbines. Multivariate analyses indicate the existence of differentiation along altitudinal gradients and along a gradient of climatic conditions determined by the summer precipitation and temperatures. However, climatic conditions related to winter temperature and precipitation, as well as soil properties, were equally likely to show conservatism or divergence. The complex patterns of niche evolution we found suggest that Iberian Columbines have not been significantly constrained by forces of niche conservatism, so they could respond adaptively to the fast and profound climate changes in the Iberian Peninsula through the glacial cycles of the Pleistocene.},

  abstract = {Predators typically are larger than their prey, and consequently, trophic level should increase with body size. Whereas this relationship has helped in developing predictions about food web structure and dynamics in mesocosms and simple communities, a trophiclevel\textendash body-size relationship may not exist for all kinds of communities or taxa, especially those with many non-carnivorous species. Moreover, functional traits associated with trophic level generally have not been considered. Herein, we examine the correlation between trophic level and body size in fishes and how this relationship may vary in relation to functional traits (body dimensions, mouth size and orientation, tooth shape, gill rakers, and gut length) and trophic guilds (carnivorous vs. non-carnivorous). We analyzed data from morphological measurements and dietary analyses performed on thousands of specimens from freshwater and estuarine habitats across three zoogeographic regions (Neartic, Neotropical, and Afrotropical). A positive relationship between trophic level and body size was only found for carnivorous fishes. No relationship was found when all species were analyzed together, rejecting the idea that trophic level is positively related with body size in fishes generally. This result was consistent even when using either body mass or standard length as the measure of body size, and trophic level for either species (average values) or individual specimens as the response variable. At the intraspecific level, trophic level varied consistently with size for one third of the species, among which only 40\% had positive relationships. Body depth, tooth shape, and mouth width were all associated with the trophic-level\textendash body-size relationship. Overall, predators with conical or triangular serrated teeth, large mouths, and elongated/and/or fusiform bodies tend to have positive trophic-level\textendash body-size relationships, whereas primarily non-carnivorous species with unicuspid or multicuspid teeth, deep bodies and small to medium sized mouth gapes tended to have negative relationships. Given the diverse ecological strategies encompassed by fishes, trophic level and food web patterns and processes should not be inferred based solely on body size. Research that integrates multiple functional traits with trophic ecology will improve understanding and predictions about food web structure and dynamics.},

To date, trait-based approaches have been used to study taxa from microbes to megafauna in every major area of aquatic ecology yielding exciting results. However, this promising field faces a number of significant obstacles, including: (1) identifying and measuring ecologically relevant traits, (2) integrating inter- and intra-specific trait variation, (3) detecting and quantifying trait correlations and trade-offs, and (4) accounting for the context dependency of traits. These issues are often particularly acute for specific taxa or systems. This paper highlights these looming challenges, as well as ways to address them. Proposed solutions center around using new technologies to collect trait data, coordinating research efforts, and curating and sharing data. Throughout, we take an interdisciplinary approach, sharing examples spanning a wide range of aquatic taxa and systems. It is our hope that this paper will stimulate frank discussions and help the growing field of trait-based aquatic ecology maximize its potential.},

This framework was mostly limited to quantitative traits without missing values and to situations in which there are more species than traits, although the authors had suggested a way to extend their framework to other trait types. The main purpose of this note is to further develop this suggestion. We describe a highly flexible distance-based framework to measure different facets of FD in multidimensional trait space from any distance or dissimilarity measure, any number of traits, and from different trait types (i.e., quantitative, semi-quantitative, and qualitative). This new approach allows for missing trait values and the weighting of individual traits. We also present a new multidimensional FD index, called functional dispersion (FDis), which is closely related to Rao's quadratic entropy. FDis is the multivariate analogue of the weighted mean absolute deviation (MAD), in which the weights are species relative abundances. For unweighted presence\textendash absence data, FDis can be used for a formal statistical test of differences in FD. We provide the ``FD'' R language package to easily implement our distance-based FD framework.},

A common framework, including freshwater, marine, benthic, and pelagic ecologists, is needed to bridge communication gaps and foster knowledge sharing. This framework should transcend local specificities and taxonomy in order to provide a common ground and shareable tools to address common scientific challenges. Here, we advocate the use of functional trait-based approaches (FTBAs) for aquatic ecologists and propose concrete paths to go forward. Firstly, we propose to unify existing definitions in FTBAs to adopt a common language. Secondly, we list the numerous databases referencing functional traits for aquatic organisms. Thirdly, we present a synthesis on traditional as well as recent promising methods for the study of aquatic functional traits, including imaging and genomics. Finally, we conclude with a highlight on scientific challenges and promising venues for which FTBAs should foster opportunities for future research. By offering practical tools, our framework provides a clear path forward to the adoption of trait-based approaches in aquatic ecology.},

C'est ce type d'\'ecosyst\`emes qui font souvent l'objet d'un statut de protection dans le cadre de l'\'etablissement d'une AMP. C'est dans ce contexte que nous nous sommes int\'eress\'es au peuplement ichthyique de la zone de Malloula, situ\'ee dans le Nord Ouest de la Tunisie.

La majorit\'e des \'ecologistes admettent que la diversit\'e fonctionnelle traduit mieux la relation biodiversit\'e-fonctionnement des \'ecosyst\`emes que la diversit\'e sp\'ecifique. Nous avons donc cherch\'e \`a pr\'eciser la structure fonctionnelle des peuplements de poissons de la Baie de Malloula en identifiant les diff\'erents groupes fonctionnels la composant. Pour cela, nous avons mesur\'e 19 traits \'ecomorphologiques sur les diff\'erents individus de chaque esp\`ece. Ces traits ont permis de calculer 17 traits fonctionnels (7 pour caract\'eriser la fonction de locomotion et 10 pour l'acquisition des ressources trophiques), dont les valeurs ont \'et\'e utilis\'ees pour faire une Analyse en Composante Principale (ACP) pour chaque fonction. Deux partitions rassemblent les esp\`eces \'etudi\'ees en 11 et 9 groupes fonctionnels coh\'erents pour, respectivement, les fonctions d'acquisition des ressources trophiques et la locomotion. Cette \'etude a mis en \'evidence la richesse et la diversit\'e fonctionnelle de la baie de Malloula et justifie de ce fait son futur statut d'Aire Marine Prot\'eg\'ee (AMP). Parmi ces groupes fonctionnels, 7 sont monosp\'ecifiques comme (Sarpa salpa, Trachinus draco, Parablennius sanguinolentus, Lipophrys basiliscus, Solea vulgaris, Liza aurata et Gobius paganellus), c'est \`a dire qu'ils sont constitu\'es d'esp\`eces fonctionnellement uniques dont l'\'eventuelle disparition entra\^inera la disparition d\'efinitive de la fonction qu'elles assurent car elles ne seront pas remplac\'ees par des esp\`eces \'equivalentes.

The deep sea provides a natural environmental gradient within which to study changes in different diversity metrics, but traits of deep-sea fish are not widely known, hampering the application of functional diversity to this globally important system. We used morphological traits to determine the functional richness and functional divergence of demersal fish assemblages along the continental slope in the Northeast Atlantic, at depths of 300\textendash 2,000 m. We compared these metrics to size diversity based on individual body size and species richness. Functional richness and size diversity showed similar patterns, with the highest diversity at intermediate depths; functional divergence showed the opposite pattern, with the highest values at the shallowest and deepest parts of the study site. Species richness increased with depth. The functional implications of these patterns were deduced by examining depth-related changes in morphological traits and the dominance of feeding guilds as illustrated by stable isotope analyses. The patterns in diversity and the variation in certain morphological traits can potentially be explained by changes in the relative dominance of pelagic and benthic feeding guilds. All measures of diversity examined here suggest that the deep areas of the continental slope may be equally or more diverse than assemblages just beyond the continental shelf.},

  abstract = {The use of models by ecologists and environmental managers, to inform environmental management and decision-making, has grown exponentially in the past 50 yr. Due to logistical, economical, and theoretical benefits, model users frequently transfer preexisting models to new sites where data are scarce. Modelers have made significant progress in understanding how to improve model generalizability during model development. However, models are always imperfect representations of systems and are constrained by the contextual frameworks used during their development. Thus, model users need better ways to evaluate the possibility of unintentional misapplication when transferring models to new sites. We propose a method of describing a model's application niche for use during the model selection process. Using this method, model users synthesize information from databases, past studies, and/or past model transfers to create model performance curves and heat maps. We demonstrated this method using an empirical model developed to predict the ecological condition of plant communities in riverine wetlands of the Appalachian Highland physiographic region, USA. We assessed this model's transferability and generalizability across (1) riverine wetlands in the contiguous United States, (2) wetland types in the Appalachian Highland physiographic region, and (3) wetland types in the contiguous United States. With this methodology and a discussion of its critical steps, we set the stage for further inquiries into the development of consistent and transparent practices for model selection when transferring a model.},

  abstract = {The concept of niche overlap appears in studies of the mechanisms of the maintenance of species diversity, in searches for assembly rules, and in estimation of within-community species redundancy. For plant traits measured on a continuous scale, existing indices are inadequate because they split the scale into a number of categories thus losing information. An index is easy to construct if we assume a normal distribution for each trait within a species, but this assumption is rarely true. We extend and apply an index, NO(K), which is based on kernel density functions, and can therefore work with distributions of any shape without prior assumptions. For cases where the ecologist wishes to downweight traits that are inter-correlated, we offer a variant that does this: NO(Kw). From either of these indices, an index of the mean niche overlap in a community can be calculated: NO(K,community) and NO(Kw,community). For all these indices, the variance can be calculated and formulae for this are given. To give examples of the new indices in use, we apply them to a coastal fish dataset and a sand-dune plant dataset. The former exhibits considerable non-normality, emphasising the need for kernel-based indices. Accordingly, there was a considerable difference in index values, with those for an index based on a normal distribution being significantly higher than those from an index which, being based on kernel fitting, is not biased by an assumption for the distribution. The NO(K) values were ecologically consistent for the fish species concerned, varying from 0.02 to 0.53. The sand-dune plant data also showed a wide range of overlap values. Interestingly, the least overlap was between two graminoids, which would have been placed in the same functional group in the coarse classification often used in functional-type/ecosystem-function work.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY 1. The prediction of species distributions is of primary importance in ecology and conservation biology. Statistical models play an important role in this regard; however, researchers have little guidance when choosing between competing methodologies because few comparative studies have been conducted. 2. We provide a comprehensive comparison of traditional and alternative techniques for predicting species distributions using logistic regression analysis, linear discriminant analysis, classification trees and artificial neural networks to model: (1) the presence/absence of 27 fish species as a function of habitat conditions in 286 temperate lakes located in south-central Ontario, Canada and (2) simulated data sets exhibiting deterministic, linear and non-linear species response curves. 3. Detailed evaluation of model predictive power showed that approaches produced species models that differed in overall correct classification, specificity (i.e. ability to correctly predict species absence) and sensitivity (i.e. ability to correctly predict speciespresence) and in terms of which of the study lakes they correctly classified. Onaverage, neural networks outperformed the other modelling approaches, although all approaches predicted species presence/absence with moderate to excellent success. 4. Based on simulated non-linear data, classification trees and neural networks greatly outperformed traditional approaches, whereas all approaches exhibited similar correct classification rates when modelling simulated linear data. 5. Detailed evaluation of model explanatory insight showed that the relative importance of the habitat variables in the species models varied among the approaches, where habitat variable importance was similar among approaches for some species and very different for others. 6. In general, differences in predictive power (both correct classification rate and identity of the lakes correctly classified) among the approaches corresponded with differences in habitat variable importance, suggesting that non-linear modelling approaches (i.e. classification trees and neural networks) are better able to capture and model complex, non-linear patterns found in ecological data. The results from the comparisons using simulated data further support this notion. 7. By employing parallel modelling approaches with the same set of data and focusing on comparing multiple metrics of predictive performance, researchers can begin to choose predictive models that not only provide the greatest predictive power, but also best fit the proposed application.},

Despite this importance, the ecological niche dynamics (i.e., those relating to trophic behavior and food-web interactions) of these sympatric species are poorly understood, knowledge of which may be consequential for maintaining both ecosystem function and fishery sustainability. We used stable isotope ratios of carbon ({$\delta$}13C) and nitrogen ({$\delta$}15N) to build realized ecological niche hypervolumes to serve as proxies for diet and production use patterns of L. chamaeleonticeps and C. microps. We hypothesized that: (a) species exhibit ontogenetic shifts in diet and use of production sources; (b) species acquire energy from spatially distinct resource pools that reflect a sedentary life-history and differential use of the continental shelf-edge; and (c) species exhibit differentiation in one or more measured niche axes. We found evidence for ontogenetic shifts in diet ({$\delta$}15N) but not production source ({$\delta$}13C) in both species, suggesting a subtle expansion of measured ecological niche axes. Spatial interpolation of stable isotope ratios showed distinct latitudinal gradients; for example, individuals were 13C enriched in northern and 15N enriched in southern regions, supporting the assertion that tilefish species acquire energy from regional resource pools. High isotopic overlap was observed among species ({$\geq$}82\%); however, when hypervolumes included depth and region of capture, overlap among species substantially decreased to overlap estimates of 15\%\textendash 77\%. This suggests that spatial segregation could alleviate potential competition for resources among tilefish species inhabiting continental shelf-edge environments. Importantly, our results question the consensus interpretation of isotopic overlap estimates as representative of direct competition among species for shared resources or habitats, instead identifying habitat segregation as a possible mechanism for coexistence of tilefish species in the NW Atlantic.},

We also examined the relationship between functional diversity of fish assemblages and indices of biotic integrity and habitat quality. Environmental characteristics at the local reach and catchment scales, including the extent of forested area in the watershed, amount of land developed for urban and agricultural uses, stream size, substrate characteristics, and availability of riffle and pool habitats, were significantly associated with functional trait composition of fish assemblages. Broad physiographic differences between ecoregions also had a large influence on taxonomic and functional assemblage structure. In general, the volume of functional trait space occupied by fish assemblages was greatest in streams with high habitat quality scores located within landscapes having less alteration from agriculture and urban development. Distributions of functional traits in fish assemblages might provide an additional basis for assessment of stream condition in relation to environmental impacts.},

Various characteristics of FD make it preferable to other measures of functional diversity, such as the number of functional groups in a community. Simulating species' trait values illustrates how the relative importance of richness and composition for FD depends on the effective dimensionality of the trait space in which species separate. Fewer dimensions increase the importance of community composition and functional redundancy. More dimensions increase the importance of species richness and decreases functional redundancy. Clumping of species in trait space increases the relative importance of community composition. Five natural communities show remarkably similar relationships between FD and species richness.},

Ecological models are currently one of the strongest approaches used to predicting and understanding the consequences of anthropogenic and climate-driven changes in the natural environment. We assess the most commonly used capabilities of the modelling community to provide information about indicators outlined in the MSFD, particularly on biodiversity, food webs, non-indigenous species and seafloor integrity descriptors. We built a catalogue of models and their derived indicators to assess which models were able to demonstrate: (1) the linkages between indicators and ecosystem structure and function and (2) the impact of pressures on ecosystem state through indicators. Our survey identified 44 ecological models being implemented in Europe, with a high prevalence of those that focus on links between hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry, followed by end-to-end, species distribution/habitat suitability, bio-optical (remote sensing) and multispecies models. Approximately 200 indicators could be derived from these models, the majority of which were biomass and physical/hydrological/chemical indicators. Biodiversity and food webs descriptors, with {$\sim$}49\% and {$\sim$}43\% respectively, were better addressed in the reviewed modelling approaches than the non-indigenous species (0.3\%) and sea floor integrity ({$\sim$}8\%) descriptors. Out of 12 criteria and 21 MSFD indicators relevant to the abovementioned descriptors, currently only three indicators were not addressed by the 44 models reviewed. Modelling approaches showed also the potential to inform on the complex, integrative ecosystem dimensions while addressing ecosystem fundamental properties, such as interactions between structural components and ecosystems services provided, despite the fact that they are not part of the MSFD indicators set. The cataloguing of models and their derived indicators presented in this study, aim at helping the planning and integration of policies like the MSFD which require the assessment of all European Seas in relation to their ecosystem status and pressures associated and the establishment of environmental targets (through the use of indicators) to achieve GEnS by 2020.},

Data included variables on fish assemblage structure, local environmental variables, sampling strategy and a river basin classification based on native fish fauna similarities accounting for regional effects on local assemblage structure. Fifty-eight metrics reflecting different aspects of fish assemblage structure and function were selected from the available literature and tested for their potential to indicate habitat degradation. 3 To quantify possible deviation from a `reference condition' for any given site, we first established and validated statistical models describing metric responses to natural environmental variability in the absence of any significant human disturbance. We considered that the residual distributions of these models described the response range of each metric, whatever the natural environmental variability. After testing the sensitivity of these residuals to a gradient of human disturbance, we finally selected 10 metrics that were combined to obtain a European fish assemblage index. We demonstrated that (i) when considering only minimally disturbed sites the index remains invariant, regardless of environmental variability, and (ii) the index shows a significant negative linear response to a gradient of human disturbance. 4 Synthesis and applications. In this reference condition modelling approach, by including a more complete description of environmental variability at both local and regional scales it was possible to develop a novel fish biotic index transferable between catchments at the European scale. The use of functional metrics based on biological attributes of species instead of metrics based on species themselves reduced the index sensitivity to the variability of fish fauna across different biogeographical areas.},

Myctophids possess a unique communication system of species-specific photophore patterns and traditional intrafamilial classification has been established to reflect arrangements of photophores.

  abstract = {It is well known that predators can induce morphological changes in some fish: individuals exposed to predation cues increase body depth and the length of spines. We hypothesize that these structures may evolve synergistically, as together, these traits will further enlarge the body dimensions of the fish that gape-limited predators must overcome. We therefore expect that the orientation of the spines will predict which body dimension increases in the presence of predators. Using phylogenetic comparative methods, we tested this prediction on the macroevolutionary scale across 347 teleost families, which display considerable variation in fin spines, body depth and width. Consistent with our predictions, we demonstrate that fin spines on the vertical plane (dorsal and anal fins) are associated with a deeper-bodied optimum. Lineages with spines on the horizontal plane (pectoral fins) are associated with a wider-bodied optimum. Optimal body dimensions across lineages without spines paralleling the body dimension match the allometric expectation. Additionally, lineages with longer spines have deeper and wider body dimensions. This evolutionary relationship between fin spines and body dimensions across teleosts reveals functional synergy between these two traits and a potential macroevolutionary signature of predation on the evolutionary dynamics of body shape.},

Fish dominated the diet in terms of relative abundance (86\%N), and reconstituted mass (60\%M), the most important being Maurolicus muelleri (79\%N, 23\%M), Scomberesox saurus (2\%N, 30\%M), and Arctozenus risso (4\%N, 4\%M).

Various indices have been proposed to measure relevant aspects of community trait composition from different viewpoints and perspectives. Among these, the 'community-weighted mean trait value' (CWM) and the Rao coefficient have been widely used in ecological research for summarizing different facets of functional composition and diversity. Analyzing changes in functional diversity of bee communities along a post-fire successional gradient in southern Switzerland we show that these two measures may be used to describe two complementary aspects of community structure, such as the mean and the dispersion of functional traits within a given species assemblage. While CWM can be adequately used to summarize shifts in mean trait values within communities due to environmental selection for certain functional traits, the Rao coefficient can be effectively applied to analyze patterns of trait convergence or divergence compared to a random expectation.},

  abstract = {This analysis deals with size variations in the breeding territories of land birds which obtain most or all of their food on the territory. For the species studied as a whole, territory size shows a strong positive relationship to body weight. Predators tend to have larger territories than omnivores or herbivores of the same weight, presumably due to the relatively denser food of the latter species. The home ranges of raptors inhabiting two areas were found to be significantly correlated with an index of the numerical density of their prey and in one area with raptor weight. Higher clutch size is not significantly associated with larger territories in any category of birds tested. The number of individuals defending the territory and the number feeding the young are probably not correlated with territory size. The exponential relationships between body weight of the consumer and three dependent variables\textendash food biomass consumed per unit time, average prey weight and territory or home range size\textendash are used to derive three predictions: a) Heavier predators take fewer individuals per unit time than lighter species; b) If certain restrictions are satisfied, the collective biomasses in a given large area increase as individual biomasses become larger for omnivorous species and decrease as individual biomasses increase for predators; c) For predators, the density of acceptable and accessible food in biomass per unit area decreases as the weight of the consumer increases. Territory or home range size increases more rapidly with body weight for predators than for omnivores or herbivores. This relationship holds true for both birds and mammals and presumably reflects a rapidly decreasing food density for predators of increasing weight. Since smaller predators do not feed over a wider range of food size than larger species, and since there are less species or individuals feeding on large food than on small, the predators of the areas studied probably consume food whose distribution of biomass with food size is declining. The habit of feeding on exclusive areas is considerably more widespread among predators than among omnivores and herbivores. The smaller spatial needs for omnivorous and herbivorous birds of a given biomass and perhaps the greater patchiness of their food when compared to predators are used to explain the higher occurrence of gregarious nesting in the former group. Implications of this study for the functions of feeding territories maintained during the breeding season are discussed.},

Answering this question would help predict a predator's diet and improve our understanding of how an ecosystem functions. The aim of this study was to test if the diet of common dolphins, Delphinus delphis, in the oceanic Bay of Biscay reflected prey availability or a selection shaped by prey energy densities (ED). To do this, the community of potential prey species, described both in terms of relative abundance and energy densities, was compared to the common dolphin diet in this area. This analysis of a predator's diet and its prey field revealed that the common dolphin selected its diet on the basis of prey energy densities (significant values of Chesson's index for ED{$>$}5kJg-1). High-energy prey were positively selected in the diet [e.g. Notoscopelus kroeyeri, ED=7.9kJg-1, 9\% of relative abundance in the environment (\%Ne); 62\% of relative abundance in the diet (\%Nd)] and low-energy prey disregarded (Xenodermichthys copei, ED=2.1kJg-1, 20\%Ne, 0\%Nd). These results supported the hypothesis that common dolphins selected high energy density prey species to meet their energetically expensive life style and disregard prey organisms of poor energy content even when abundant in the environment.},

The 100th anniversary of the British Ecological Society in 2013 is an opportune moment to reflect on the current status of ecology as a science and look forward to high-light priorities for future work. To do this, we identified 100 important questions of fundamental importance in pure ecology. We elicited questions from ecologists working across a wide range of systems and disciplines. The 754 questions submitted (listed in the online appendix) from 388 participants were narrowed down to the final 100 through a process of discussion, rewording and repeated rounds of voting. This was done during a two-day workshop and thereafter. The questions reflect many of the important current conceptual and technical pre-occupations of ecology. For example, many questions concerned the dynamics of environmental change and complex ecosystem interactions, as well as the interaction between ecology and evolution. The questions reveal a dynamic science with novel subfields emerging. For example, a group of questions was dedicated to disease and micro-organisms and another on human impacts and global change reflecting the emergence of new subdisciplines that would not have been foreseen a few decades ago. The list also contained a number of questions that have perplexed ecologists for decades and are still seen as crucial to answer, such as the link between population dynamics and life-history evolution. Synthesis. These 100 questions identified reflect the state of ecology today. Using them as an agenda for further research would lead to a substantial enhancement in understanding of the discipline, with practical relevance for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem function.},

  abstract = {Imaging techniques are increasingly used in ecology studies, producing vast quantities of data. Inferring functional traits from individual images can provide original insights on ecosystem processes. Morphological traits are, as other functional traits, individual characteristics influencing an organism's fitness. We measured them from in situ image data to study an Arctic zooplankton community during sea ice break-up. Morphological descriptors (e.g., area, lightness, complexity) were automatically measured on {$\sim$} 28,000 individual copepod images from a high-resolution underwater camera deployed at more than 150 sampling sites across the ice-edge. A statistically-defined morphological space allowed synthesizing morphological information into interpretable and continuous traits (size, opacity, and appendages visibility). This novel approach provides theoretical and methodological advantages because it gives access to both inter- and intra-specific variability by automatically analyzing a large dataset of individual images. The spatial distribution of morphological traits revealed that large copepods are associated with ice-covered waters, while open waters host smaller individuals. In those ice-free waters, copepods also seem to feed more actively, as suggested by the increased visibility of their appendages. These traits distributions are likely explained by bottom-up control: high phytoplankton concentrations in the well-lit open waters encourages individuals to actively feed and stimulates the development of small copepod stages. Furthermore, copepods located at the ice edge were opaquer, presumably because of full guts or an increase in red pigmentation. Our morphological trait-based approach revealed ecological patterns that would have been inaccessible otherwise, including color and posture variations of copepods associated with ice-edge environments in Arctic ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Despite growing attention on the influence of functional diversity changes on ecosystem functioning, a palaeoecological perspective on the long-term dynamic of functional diversity, including mass extinction crises, is still lacking. Here, using a novel multidimensional functional framework and comprehensive null-models, we compare the functional structure of Cambrian, Silurian and modern benthic marine biotas. We demonstrate that, after controlling for increases in taxonomic diversity, functional richness increased incrementally between each time interval with benthic taxa filling progressively more functional space, combined with a significant functional dissimilarity between periods. The modern benthic biota functionally overlaps with fossil biotas but some modern taxa, especially large predators, have new trait combinations that may allow more functions to be performed. From a methodological perspective, these results illustrate the benefits of using multidimensional instead of lower dimensional functional frameworks when studying changes in functional diversity over space and time.},

  abstract = {In its simplest definition, a trait is a surrogate of organismal performance, and this meaning of the term has been used by evolutionists for a long time. Over the last three decades, developments in community and ecosystem ecology have forced the concept of trait beyond these original boundaries, and trait-based approaches are now widely used in studies ranging from the level of organisms to that of ecosystems. Despite some attempts to fix the terminology, especially in plant ecology, there is currently a high degree of confusion in the use, not only of the term ``trait'' itself, but also in the underlying concepts it refers to. We therefore give an unambiguous definition of plant trait, with a particular emphasis on functional trait. A hierarchical perspective is proposed, extending the ``performance paradigm'' to plant ecology. ``Functional traits'' are defined as morpho-physio-phenological traits which impact fitness indirectly via their effects on growth, reproduction and survival, the three components of individual performance. We finally present an integrative framework explaining how changes in trait values due to environmental variations are translated into organismal performance, and how these changes may influence processes at higher organizational levels. We argue that this can be achieved by developing ``integration functions'' which can be grouped into functional response (community level) and effect (ecosystem level) algorithms.},

  pages = {14},
  abstract = {In the present paper, an attempt is made to investigate whether the body shape indices can be used to predict food habits of fish species in three reservoir fish communities of Sri Lanka. The present analysis is based on the studies on food and feeding habits of fish species and their body shape indices in three Sri Lankan reservoirs, namely Minneriya, Udawalawe and Victoria. Body proportions of individual fish species were determined as P1 (= Maximum height of the body/ Maximum width of the body) and P2 (= Total length/ Maximum height of the body), which were found to be negative curvilinearly related. Trophic indices (Ti) of individual fish species were determined on the basis of trophic level of each food item and the fractions of all food items consumed by fish species, which ranged from 1 for exclusively herbivorous species to 3 for carnivorous species. A negative logarithmic relationship between P1 and Ti indicates that laterally compressed fish species with deep bodies feed on lower trophic levels in the food web. On the other hand, dorso-ventrally flattened species with low P1 have higher trophic indices than those with high P1. The positive logarithmic relationship between P2 and Ti also indicates that short, deep-bodied fish species representing low P2 values feed on lower trophic levels whereas slender, long-bodied species with high P2 values feed on higher trophic levels. The body shapes, measured as simple body proportions of the definitions of P1 and P2, can therefore be used to predict feeding habits of fish.},

  abstract = {Color polymorphisms offer unique opportunities for testing the role of ecological adaptation and natural selection in the origin of species. However, the ecological conditions that facilitate the coexistence and speciation of color morphs in nature remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the ecological mechanisms maintaining the color polymorphism in the arc-eye hawkfish (Paracirrhites arcatus), which consists of two common morphs (pink white-striped [PWS] and melanistic [MEL]) and less common intermediates that all coexist on shallow coral reefs throughout the Indo-Pacific. Our approach was to test whether ecologically based disruptive selection on color could explain the maintenance of and possible incipient divergence between sympatric color morphs. We compared patterns of spatial distribution, abundance, habitat use and preference, and niche overlap among color morphs at nine sites along the leeward coast of Hawaii Island. We demonstrate that despite co-occurring at all sites, sympatric color morphs show significant niche divergence along a steep ecological gradient. Morph frequencies correlate strongly with a multivariate gradient in coral community and reef topography, which explained 81\% of the variability in relative abundance of the two main color morphs. Melanistic morphs were more frequent in shallow, steep surge zones dominated by Pocillopora corals. In contrast, PWS morphs were more frequent in deeper, sub-surge zones with higher coral cover dominated by Porites corals. Niche overlap analyses highlight how the two main morphs are partitioned on opposite ends of this continuous ecological gradient, while phenotypic intermediates are mostly restricted to intermediate habitats. The strong correlation between phenotype and environment suggests that morphs have fitness advantages in their respective habitats. We speculate that disruptive natural selection on color pattern to increase crypsis in heterogeneous visual environments has led to divergence in habitat preferences. The resulting ecological isolation provides a plausible mechanism for the persistence of multiple coexisting color phenotypes in P. arcatus. If divergence in color also affects mate choice, the evolution of reproductive isolation is likely to be promoted.},

  abstract = {Ecology is often said to lack general theories sufficiently predictive for applications. Here, we examine the concept of a periodic table of niches and feasibility of niche classification schemes from functional trait and performance data. Niche differences and their influence on ecological patterns and processes could be revealed effectively by first performing data reduction/ordination analyses separately on matrices of trait and performance data compiled according to logical associations with five basic niche 'dimensions', or aspects: habitat, life history, trophic, defence and metabolic. Resultant patterns then are integrated to produce interpretable niche gradients, ordinations and classifications. Degree of scheme periodicity would depend on degrees of niche conservatism and convergence causing species clustering across multiple niche dimensions. We analysed a sample data set containing trait and performance data to contrast two approaches for producing niche schemes: species ordination within niche gradient space, and niche categorisation according to trait-value thresholds. Creation of niche schemes useful for advancing ecological knowledge and its applications will depend on research that produces functional trait and performance datasets directly related to niche dimensions along with criteria for data standardisation and quality. As larger databases are compiled, opportunities will emerge to explore new methods for data reduction, ordination and classification. \textcopyright{} 2015 The Authors.

Here, we assess the importance of prey depletion as a driver of large carnivore endangerment globally using lists of prey species for each large carnivore compiled from the literature. We consider spatial variation in prey endangerment, changes in endangerment over time and the causes of prey depletion, finding considerable evidence that loss of prey base is a major and wide-ranging threat among large carnivore species. In particular, the clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa), Sunda clouded leopard (Neofelis diardi), tiger (Panthera tigris), dhole (Cuon alpinus) and Ethiopian wolf (Canis simensis) all have at least 40\% of their prey classified as threatened on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List and, along with the leopard (Panethra pardus), all of these species except the Ethiopian wolf have at least 50\% of their prey classified as declining. Of the 494 prey species in our analysis, an average of just 6.9\% of their ranges overlap protected areas. Together these results show the importance of a holistic approach to conservation that involves protecting both large carnivores directly and the prey upon which they depend.},
