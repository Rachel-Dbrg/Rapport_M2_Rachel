  abstract = {Fish diets provide information that can be used to explore and model complex ecosystems, and infer resource partitioning among species. The exhaustive sampling of prey items captured by each species remains, however, a demanding task. Therefore, predicting diets from other variables, such as functional traits, may be a valuable method. Here, we attempted to predict trophic guild and diet overlap for 35 fish species using 13 ecomorphological traits related to feeding ecology. We compared linear discriminant analysis and random forest (RF) classifiers in their ability to predict trophic guild. We used generalized dissimilarity modelling to predict diet overlap from functional distances between species pairs. All models were evaluated using the same cross-validation procedure. We found that fish trophic guilds were accurately predicted by an RF classifier, even with a limited number of traits, when no more than 7 guilds were defined. Prediction was no longer accurate when finer trophic guilds were created (8 or more guilds), whatever the combination of traits. Furthermore, predicting the degree of diet dissimilarity between species pairs, based on their ecomorphological traits dissimilarities, was profoundly unreliable (at least 76\% of unexplained variation). These results suggest that we can predict fish trophic guilds accurately from ecomorphological traits, but not diet overlap and resource partitioning because of inherent versatility in fish diets. More generally, our statistical framework may be applied to any kind of marine organism for which feeding strategies need to be determined from traits.},

Functional morphology is an effective approach to understand and compare taxonomic units with different phenotypic characteristics related to swimming and foraging. In this study, our main objective was to delineate the functional traits with a view to determine the discrimination level and degree of functional niche overlap among seven common species inhabiting deep-sea waters in south-eastern Arabian Sea. Results indicated significant differences in the functional traits between species providing a low functional niche overlap. Although, the ecological and biological information of fishes were scarce, we demonstrated that functional analyses are effective to extrapolate the prey preferences, sizes and detection and propulsion efficiencies for their feeding and swimming strategies. Our study supports the hypothesis that in some environments with a limitation of resources, species coexisting is due to high resource partitioning. The present work is a first attempt to compare the morpho-functional characteristics and niche partitioning in the deep-sea fish assemblages from the Indian waters.},

  abstract = {Biological traits offer valuable approaches to understand species distributions and underlying mechanisms. Their use has received a growing interest in marine community ecology, for both fundamental and applied purposes. The need of ecological indicators as part of marine directives and conservation programmes has promoted the use of multiple traits for indicator development, but in a questionable context regarding the state of fundamental developments. Biological Trait Analysis (BTA) is a complex research field, characterised by flexible concepts and applications. In order to enhance the development of relevant marine ecological indicators, this review provides baselines for better theoretical and applied BTA. A compilation of the existing literature reveals that specific topics have dominated the use of multiple traits in marine ecology unlike in freshwater and terrestrial ecology where tests of theories and uses of evolutionary concepts consistently preceded BTA applications. Availability of data sets and analytical techniques seemed to have driven the growing use of marine BTA rather than fundamental questions regarding life history theories in marine ecosystem components and the functional nature of traits. It is therefore suggested that greater focus on life history ecology and on the links between marine species traits and ecosystem functioning are still needed to support trait-based indicator development. Life history strategy understanding is put forward as a theoretically-sound basis and fundamental pre-requisite for trait-based marine indicator development.},

We determined the diets of the most abundant intertidal fishes from 3 central California sites by examining gut contents. A matrix of dietary overlap among species within the Californian and Chilean assemblages (diets of Chilean fishes determined in another study) was constructed, and statistically significant guilds were determined using a bootstrapping procedure. Ten morphological features were examined for species in each region, and the relationship between diet and consumer morphology was evaluated. Three feeding guilds, omnivore, microcarnivore, and carnivore, were common to both regions, but a fourth guild, polychaete feeders, was unique to California. Feeding guild structure was not associated with phylogenetic relatedness within either assemblage. An assemblage-wide relationship between diet and morphology was found in each assemblage, but only a few associations between diet and morphology were common to both regions. In both California and Chile, omnivores tended to have longer digestive tracts and closer-set gill rakers, microcarnivores tended to have larger relative mouth heights, and all carnivorous fishes tended to have shorter guts and more widely spaced gill rakers. Overall, interregional morphological patterns were associated with phylogenetic relatedness, rather than with dietary similarities.},

  abstract = {Understanding the relationships between species biological traits and the environment is crucial to predicting the effect of habitat perturbations on fish communities. It is also an essential step in the assessment of the functional diversity. Using two complementary three-matrix approaches (fourth-corner and RLQ analyses), we tested the hypothesis that feeding-oriented traits determine the spatial distributions of littoral fish species by assessing the relationship between fish spatial distributions, fish species traits, and habitat characteristics in two Laurentian Shield lakes. Significant associations between the feeding-oriented traits and the environmental characteristics suggested that fish communities in small lakes (displaying low species richness) can be spatially structured. Three groups of traits, mainly categorized by the species spatial and temporal feeding activity, were identified. The water column may be divided in two sections, each of them corresponding to a group of traits related to the vertical distribution of the prey coupled with the position of the mouth. Lake areas of low structural complexity were inhabited by functional assemblages dominated by surface feeders while structurally more complex areas were occupied by mid-water and benthic feeders. A third group referring to the time of feeding activity was observed. Our work could serve as a guideline study to evaluate species traits 3 environment associations at multiple spatial scales. Our results indicate that three-matrix statistical approaches are powerful tools that can be used to study such relationships. These recent statistical approaches open up new research directions such as the study of spatially based biological functions in lakes. They also provide new analytical tools for determining, for example, the potential size of freshwater protected areas.},

  abstract = {Aim Concerns over how global change will influence species distributions, in conjunction with increased emphasis on understanding niche dynamics in evolutionary and community contexts, highlight the growing need for robust methods to quantify niche differences between or within taxa. We propose a statistical framework to describe and compare environmental niches from occurrence and spatial environmental data. Location Europe, North America and South America. Methods The framework applies kernel smoothers to densities of species occurrence in gridded environmental space to calculate metrics of niche overlap and test hypotheses regarding niche conservatism. We use this framework and simulated species with pre-defined distributions and amounts of niche overlap to evaluate several ordination and species distribution modelling techniques for quantifying niche overlap. We illustrate the approach with data on two well-studied invasive species. Results We show that niche overlap can be accurately detected with the framework when variables driving the distributions are known. The method is robust to known and previously undocumented biases related to the dependence of species occurrences on the frequency of environmental conditions that occur across geographical space. The use of a kernel smoother makes the process of moving from geographical space to multivariate environmental space independent of both sampling effort and arbitrary choice of resolution in environmental space. However, the use of ordination and species distribution model techniques for selecting, combining and weighting variables on which niche overlap is calculated provide contrasting results. Main conclusions The framework meets the increasing need for robust methods to quantify niche differences. It is appropriate for studying niche differences between species, subspecies or intra-specific lineages that differ in their geographical distributions. Alternatively, it can be used to measure the degree to which the environmental niche of a species or intra-specific lineage has changed over time.},

  abstract = {Investigating the drivers of fish assemblage trophic structure is a critical question, in order to better understand ecosystem functioning, predict the effects of perturbations and implement integrated management of exploited marine ecosystems. Ecosystemic surveys enabled the determination of the trophic structure of the fish assemblages in three French marine ecosystems, namely the Eastern English Channel, the Bay of Biscay and the Gulf of Lions, through the simultaneous collection of qualitative (stable isotopes and energy content) and quantitative (biomass) data. In the Bay of Biscay and in the Gulf of Lions, pelagic primary production supported at least 80\% of the fish biomass production, and explained the dominance of pelagic species, but with differences resulting from the different productivity. The lower productivity in the oligotrophic Gulf of Lions led to a lower total biomass, energy density as well as the predominance of zooplankton-feeders. In contrast, fluxes in the Bay of Biscay were sufficient to support a higher biomass of pelagic piscivores, and of species with higher energy content. In the shallow Eastern English Channel, the respective contributions of pelagic and benthic sources were similar. Bentho-demersal species of higher trophic level dominated this assemblage, because of their ability to exploit both pathways. Results of the present study confirmed that fisheries-focused surveys can be used as efficient platforms to address questions about ecosystem functioning. Here, it confirmed the expected differences between ecosystems and the importance of primary production and environment as drivers of fish assemblage structure and functioning. Future studies should nevertheless develop new methods to better assess the paramount role of low trophic level consumers.},

  pages = {66},
  abstract = {A methodological approach based on fish ecomorphology was chosen to predict potential fish diet. This study tests a method used in earlier research on a marine ecosystem containing phylogenetically diverse organisms: the North Sea. Fish feeding morphology imposes constraints on feeding options. A bottom-up perspective was used to describe the demands that food makes on fish feeding morphology. A set of quantitative morphological variables were measured on fish and compared to the demands made by different food-categories. Common North Sea Gadiformes and Pleuronectiformes were analysed. The results of the measurements were used as a basis for predictions of potential diet. Five `morphotypes' were identified: Large-mouthed flatfish, smallmouthed flatfish, soles, ling/rockling/haddock and other Gadiformes. The predictions on diet were checked by stomach content data from literature. The main conclusions were that morphology differed significantly among fish species indicating detailed morphological adaptations to specific food types. Furthermore the utilization of fast, relatively large prey were predicted better than the utilization of slow or sessile prey that is well hidden, hard to crack or otherwise `tough to handle'. Also the method failed to clearly separate different food types within this group of fast/large prey. Moreover, no clear distinction in stomach contents were found between Large-mouthed flatfish (being predicted as eating mostly shrimp) and Gadiformes (being predicted as eating mostly fish) within the group of fast prey hunters. Overall predictions succeed in separating different feeding guilds, but in some cases do not succeed in distinguishing between species. Knowledge on feeding behaviour on slow and sedentary benthic prey is a limiting factor. Also limiting the usefulness of the study is the incomplete knowledge and/or implementation of this knowledge on the distribution of both benthic fish and benthic prey items.},

  abstract = {Species of the family Sternoptychidae (hatchetfishes) occur worldwide and play critical roles by sequestering carbon, recycling nutrients, and acting as a key trophic link between epipelagic primary consumers and higher trophic levels in marine ecosystems. Nevertheless, basic knowledge on their ecology is still lacking and their functional ecology remains understudied with respect to composition, organization, functions and environment interactions. Here we integrated comprehensive information collected in the western Tropical Atlantic on the diversity, abundance, distribution and trophic ecology of hatchetfishes, including physicochemical features of their habitats and extensive carbon and nitrogen stable isotope data on its main prey groups. On this basis we defined five functional groups of hatchetfishes with different diet preference, isotopic composition, and vertical abundance peaks and reveal a possible high resource partitioning. Additionally, these species might have a different feeding tie chronology. Hence, hatchetfishes segregate in different ecological groups responding differently to environmental constraints including oxygen concentration and presenting diverse functional roles. As deep-sea species that migrate to epipelagic waters, hatchetfishes may play a key role in the transfer of subsurface photoassimilated carbon to deeper waters, a pathway through which the effects of climate change at the surface are transferred to the deep ocean. Moreover, as consumers of gelatinous organisms, these species convert ``gelatinous energy'' into ``fish energy'' readily usable by higher trophic levels, including endangered and commercially important species. This is a crucial trophic relationship that has been historically underestimated due to methodology limitations (e.g., quickly digested gelatinous organisms were probably underestimated in previous studies, based solely on stomach contents). Considering in ecosystem models this trophic relationship, as well as the functional organization of hatchetfishes, is important to properly answer key ecological questions including resource use, carbon transportation, and influence of mesopelagic community in climate change process.},

These changes in components of the Earth's biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons, but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments, observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in influencing ecosystem properties. Human activities can modify all of the above factors; here we focus on modification of these biotic controls.},

These species were first assigned to eight broad trophic guilds based on stomach contents analysis. The relationships between diet and morphology were then examined using Redundancy Analysis, after having checked for potential phylogenetical effects. Results show that, independently of any phylogenetic constraints, some of the trophic guilds could be grossly predicted from few relevant morphological attributes (i.e. relative intestinal length, standard length and mouth orientation) and thus suggest a significant link between diet and morphology. In other words, species having similar diet tend to converge to some extent on some morphological attributes. This link was nevertheless rather weak, suggesting that even if morphology may set limits to patterns of resource use, these limits are broad enough to allow fishes changing their choice of prey resources to respond to local biotic and/or abiotic conditions.},

Populations of these columbines are subject to complex patterns of divergent selection across environments, which partly explain the taxonomic structure of the group. This suggests the hypothesis that niche divergence must have occurred along the process of diversification of the group.We used MaxEnt to build environmental niche models of seven subspecies belonging to the three species of Aquilegia present in the Iberian Peninsula. From these models, we compared the environmental niches through two different approaches: ENMtools and multivariate methods.MaxEnt distributions conformed closely to the actual distribution of the study taxa. ENMtools methods failed to uncover any clear patterns of niche differentiation or conservatism in Iberian columbines. Multivariate analyses indicate the existence of differentiation along altitudinal gradients and along a gradient of climatic conditions determined by the summer precipitation and temperatures. However, climatic conditions related to winter temperature and precipitation, as well as soil properties, were equally likely to show conservatism or divergence. The complex patterns of niche evolution we found suggest that Iberian Columbines have not been significantly constrained by forces of niche conservatism, so they could respond adaptively to the fast and profound climate changes in the Iberian Peninsula through the glacial cycles of the Pleistocene.},

  abstract = {Predators typically are larger than their prey, and consequently, trophic level should increase with body size. Whereas this relationship has helped in developing predictions about food web structure and dynamics in mesocosms and simple communities, a trophiclevel\textendash body-size relationship may not exist for all kinds of communities or taxa, especially those with many non-carnivorous species. Moreover, functional traits associated with trophic level generally have not been considered. Herein, we examine the correlation between trophic level and body size in fishes and how this relationship may vary in relation to functional traits (body dimensions, mouth size and orientation, tooth shape, gill rakers, and gut length) and trophic guilds (carnivorous vs. non-carnivorous). We analyzed data from morphological measurements and dietary analyses performed on thousands of specimens from freshwater and estuarine habitats across three zoogeographic regions (Neartic, Neotropical, and Afrotropical). A positive relationship between trophic level and body size was only found for carnivorous fishes. No relationship was found when all species were analyzed together, rejecting the idea that trophic level is positively related with body size in fishes generally. This result was consistent even when using either body mass or standard length as the measure of body size, and trophic level for either species (average values) or individual specimens as the response variable. At the intraspecific level, trophic level varied consistently with size for one third of the species, among which only 40\% had positive relationships. Body depth, tooth shape, and mouth width were all associated with the trophic-level\textendash body-size relationship. Overall, predators with conical or triangular serrated teeth, large mouths, and elongated/and/or fusiform bodies tend to have positive trophic-level\textendash body-size relationships, whereas primarily non-carnivorous species with unicuspid or multicuspid teeth, deep bodies and small to medium sized mouth gapes tended to have negative relationships. Given the diverse ecological strategies encompassed by fishes, trophic level and food web patterns and processes should not be inferred based solely on body size. Research that integrates multiple functional traits with trophic ecology will improve understanding and predictions about food web structure and dynamics.},

  abstract = {Trait-based ecology, which focuses on using the traits of species and individuals to understand ecology (from populations to ecosystems), is becoming an increasingly productive and widely employed paradigm. To date, trait-based approaches have been used to study taxa from microbes to megafauna in every major area of aquatic ecology yielding exciting results. However, this promising field faces a number of significant obstacles, including: (1) identifying and measuring ecologically relevant traits, (2) integrating inter- and intra-specific trait variation, (3) detecting and quantifying trait correlations and trade-offs, and (4) accounting for the context dependency of traits. These issues are often particularly acute for specific taxa or systems. This paper highlights these looming challenges, as well as ways to address them. Proposed solutions center around using new technologies to collect trait data, coordinating research efforts, and curating and sharing data. Throughout, we take an interdisciplinary approach, sharing examples spanning a wide range of aquatic taxa and systems. It is our hope that this paper will stimulate frank discussions and help the growing field of trait-based aquatic ecology maximize its potential.},

This framework was mostly limited to quantitative traits without missing values and to situations in which there are more species than traits, although the authors had suggested a way to extend their framework to other trait types. The main purpose of this note is to further develop this suggestion. We describe a highly flexible distance-based framework to measure different facets of FD in multidimensional trait space from any distance or dissimilarity measure, any number of traits, and from different trait types (i.e., quantitative, semi-quantitative, and qualitative). This new approach allows for missing trait values and the weighting of individual traits. We also present a new multidimensional FD index, called functional dispersion (FDis), which is closely related to Rao's quadratic entropy. FDis is the multivariate analogue of the weighted mean absolute deviation (MAD), in which the weights are species relative abundances. For unweighted presence\textendash absence data, FDis can be used for a formal statistical test of differences in FD. We provide the ``FD'' R language package to easily implement our distance-based FD framework.},

Thirdly, we present a synthesis on traditional as well as recent promising methods for the study of aquatic functional traits, including imaging and genomics. Finally, we conclude with a highlight on scientific challenges and promising venues for which FTBAs should foster opportunities for future research.

  abstract = {The concept of niche overlap appears in studies of the mechanisms of the maintenance of species diversity, in searches for assembly rules, and in estimation of within-community species redundancy. For plant traits measured on a continuous scale, existing indices are inadequate because they split the scale into a number of categories thus losing information. An index is easy to construct if we assume a normal distribution for each trait within a species, but this assumption is rarely true. We extend and apply an index, NO(K), which is based on kernel density functions, and can therefore work with distributions of any shape without prior assumptions. For cases where the ecologist wishes to downweight traits that are inter-correlated, we offer a variant that does this: NO(Kw). From either of these indices, an index of the mean niche overlap in a community can be calculated: NO(K,community) and NO(Kw,community). For all these indices, the variance can be calculated and formulae for this are given. To give examples of the new indices in use, we apply them to a coastal fish dataset and a sand-dune plant dataset. The former exhibits considerable non-normality, emphasising the need for kernel-based indices. Accordingly, there was a considerable difference in index values, with those for an index based on a normal distribution being significantly higher than those from an index which, being based on kernel fitting, is not biased by an assumption for the distribution. The NO(K) values were ecologically consistent for the fish species concerned, varying from 0.02 to 0.53. The sand-dune plant data also showed a wide range of overlap values. Interestingly, the least overlap was between two graminoids, which would have been placed in the same functional group in the coarse classification often used in functional-type/ecosystem-function work.},

  abstract = {Golden and Blueline Tilefish (Lopholatilus chamaeleonticeps and Caulolatilus microps) are keystone taxa in northwest (NW) Atlantic continental shelf-edge environments due to their biotic (trophic-mediated) and abiotic (ecosystem engineering) functional roles combined with high-value fisheries. Despite this importance, the ecological niche dynamics (i.e., those relating to trophic behavior and food-web interactions) of these sympatric species are poorly understood, knowledge of which may be consequential for maintaining both ecosystem function and fishery sustainability. We used stable isotope ratios of carbon ({$\delta$}13C) and nitrogen ({$\delta$}15N) to build realized ecological niche hypervolumes to serve as proxies for diet and production use patterns of L. chamaeleonticeps and C. microps. We hypothesized that: (a) species exhibit ontogenetic shifts in diet and use of production sources; (b) species acquire energy from spatially distinct resource pools that reflect a sedentary life-history and differential use of the continental shelf-edge; and (c) species exhibit differentiation in one or more measured niche axes. We found evidence for ontogenetic shifts in diet ({$\delta$}15N) but not production source ({$\delta$}13C) in both species, suggesting a subtle expansion of measured ecological niche axes. Spatial interpolation of stable isotope ratios showed distinct latitudinal gradients; for example, individuals were 13C enriched in northern and 15N enriched in southern regions, supporting the assertion that tilefish species acquire energy from regional resource pools. High isotopic overlap was observed among species ({$\geq$}82\%); however, when hypervolumes included depth and region of capture, overlap among species substantially decreased to overlap estimates of 15\%\textendash 77\%. This suggests that spatial segregation could alleviate potential competition for resources among tilefish species inhabiting continental shelf-edge environments. Importantly, our results question the consensus interpretation of isotopic overlap estimates as representative of direct competition among species for shared resources or habitats, instead identifying habitat segregation as a possible mechanism for coexistence of tilefish species in the NW Atlantic.},

Here, we propose a means for quantifying functional diversity that may be particularly useful for determining how functional diversity is related to ecosystem functioning. This measure of functional diversity ''FD'' is defined as the total branch length of a functional dendrogram. Various characteristics of FD make it preferable to other measures of functional diversity, such as the number of functional groups in a community. Simulating species' trait values illustrates how the relative importance of richness and composition for FD depends on the effective dimensionality of the trait space in which species separate. Fewer dimensions increase the importance of community composition and functional redundancy. More dimensions increase the importance of species richness and decreases functional redundancy. Clumping of species in trait space increases the relative importance of community composition. Five natural communities show remarkably similar relationships between FD and species richness.},

Among these, the 'community-weighted mean trait value' (CWM) and the Rao coefficient have been widely used in ecological research for summarizing different facets of functional composition and diversity. Analyzing changes in functional diversity of bee communities along a post-fire successional gradient in southern Switzerland we show that these two measures may be used to describe two complementary aspects of community structure, such as the mean and the dispersion of functional traits within a given species assemblage. While CWM can be adequately used to summarize shifts in mean trait values within communities due to environmental selection for certain functional traits, the Rao coefficient can be effectively applied to analyze patterns of trait convergence or divergence compared to a random expectation.},

The 100th anniversary of the British Ecological Society in 2013 is an opportune moment to reflect on the current status of ecology as a science and look forward to high-light priorities for future work. To do this, we identified 100 important questions of fundamental importance in pure ecology. We elicited questions from ecologists working across a wide range of systems and disciplines. The 754 questions submitted (listed in the online appendix) from 388 participants were narrowed down to the final 100 through a process of discussion, rewording and repeated rounds of voting. This was done during a two-day workshop and thereafter. The questions reflect many of the important current conceptual and technical pre-occupations of ecology. For example, many questions concerned the dynamics of environmental change and complex ecosystem interactions, as well as the interaction between ecology and evolution. The questions reveal a dynamic science with novel subfields emerging. For example, a group of questions was dedicated to disease and micro-organisms and another on human impacts and global change reflecting the emergence of new subdisciplines that would not have been foreseen a few decades ago. The list also contained a number of questions that have perplexed ecologists for decades and are still seen as crucial to answer, such as the link between population dynamics and life-history evolution. Synthesis. These 100 questions identified reflect the state of ecology today. Using them as an agenda for further research would lead to a substantial enhancement in understanding of the discipline, with practical relevance for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem function.},

  abstract = {Imaging techniques are increasingly used in ecology studies, producing vast quantities of data. Inferring functional traits from individual images can provide original insights on ecosystem processes. Morphological traits are, as other functional traits, individual characteristics influencing an organism's fitness. We measured them from in situ image data to study an Arctic zooplankton community during sea ice break-up. Morphological descriptors (e.g., area, lightness, complexity) were automatically measured on {$\sim$} 28,000 individual copepod images from a high-resolution underwater camera deployed at more than 150 sampling sites across the ice-edge. A statistically-defined morphological space allowed synthesizing morphological information into interpretable and continuous traits (size, opacity, and appendages visibility). This novel approach provides theoretical and methodological advantages because it gives access to both inter- and intra-specific variability by automatically analyzing a large dataset of individual images. The spatial distribution of morphological traits revealed that large copepods are associated with ice-covered waters, while open waters host smaller individuals. In those ice-free waters, copepods also seem to feed more actively, as suggested by the increased visibility of their appendages. These traits distributions are likely explained by bottom-up control: high phytoplankton concentrations in the well-lit open waters encourages individuals to actively feed and stimulates the development of small copepod stages. Furthermore, copepods located at the ice edge were opaquer, presumably because of full guts or an increase in red pigmentation. Our morphological trait-based approach revealed ecological patterns that would have been inaccessible otherwise, including color and posture variations of copepods associated with ice-edge environments in Arctic ecosystems.},

We demonstrate that, after controlling for increases in taxonomic diversity, functional richness increased incrementally between each time interval with benthic taxa filling progressively more functional space, combined with a significant functional dissimilarity between periods. The modern benthic biota functionally overlaps with fossil biotas but some modern taxa, especially large predators, have new trait combinations that may allow more functions to be performed.

Over the last three decades, developments in community and ecosystem ecology have forced the concept of trait beyond these original boundaries, and trait-based approaches are now widely used in studies ranging from the level of organisms to that of ecosystems. Despite some attempts to fix the terminology, especially in plant ecology, there is currently a high degree of confusion in the use, not only of the term ``trait'' itself, but also in the underlying concepts it refers to. We therefore give an unambiguous definition of plant trait, with a particular emphasis on functional trait. A hierarchical perspective is proposed, extending the ``performance paradigm'' to plant ecology. ``Functional traits'' are defined as morpho-physio-phenological traits which impact fitness indirectly via their effects on growth, reproduction and survival, the three components of individual performance. We finally present an integrative framework explaining how changes in trait values due to environmental variations are translated into organismal performance, and how these changes may influence processes at higher organizational levels. We argue that this can be achieved by developing ``integration functions'' which can be grouped into functional response (community level) and effect (ecosystem level) algorithms.},

  abstract = {In the present paper, an attempt is made to investigate whether the body shape indices can be used to predict food habits of fish species in three reservoir fish communities of Sri Lanka. The present analysis is based on the studies on food and feeding habits of fish species and their body shape indices in three Sri Lankan reservoirs, namely Minneriya, Udawalawe and Victoria. Body proportions of individual fish species were determined as P1 (= Maximum height of the body/ Maximum width of the body) and P2 (= Total length/ Maximum height of the body), which were found to be negative curvilinearly related. Trophic indices (Ti) of individual fish species were determined on the basis of trophic level of each food item and the fractions of all food items consumed by fish species, which ranged from 1 for exclusively herbivorous species to 3 for carnivorous species. A negative logarithmic relationship between P1 and Ti indicates that laterally compressed fish species with deep bodies feed on lower trophic levels in the food web. On the other hand, dorso-ventrally flattened species with low P1 have higher trophic indices than those with high P1. The positive logarithmic relationship between P2 and Ti also indicates that short, deep-bodied fish species representing low P2 values feed on lower trophic levels whereas slender, long-bodied species with high P2 values feed on higher trophic levels. The body shapes, measured as simple body proportions of the definitions of P1 and P2, can therefore be used to predict feeding habits of fish.},

  abstract = {Color polymorphisms offer unique opportunities for testing the role of ecological adaptation and natural selection in the origin of species. However, the ecological conditions that facilitate the coexistence and speciation of color morphs in nature remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the ecological mechanisms maintaining the color polymorphism in the arc-eye hawkfish (Paracirrhites arcatus), which consists of two common morphs (pink white-striped [PWS] and melanistic [MEL]) and less common intermediates that all coexist on shallow coral reefs throughout the Indo-Pacific. Our approach was to test whether ecologically based disruptive selection on color could explain the maintenance of and possible incipient divergence between sympatric color morphs. We compared patterns of spatial distribution, abundance, habitat use and preference, and niche overlap among color morphs at nine sites along the leeward coast of Hawaii Island. We demonstrate that despite co-occurring at all sites, sympatric color morphs show significant niche divergence along a steep ecological gradient. Morph frequencies correlate strongly with a multivariate gradient in coral community and reef topography, which explained 81\% of the variability in relative abundance of the two main color morphs. Melanistic morphs were more frequent in shallow, steep surge zones dominated by Pocillopora corals. In contrast, PWS morphs were more frequent in deeper, sub-surge zones with higher coral cover dominated by Porites corals. Niche overlap analyses highlight how the two main morphs are partitioned on opposite ends of this continuous ecological gradient, while phenotypic intermediates are mostly restricted to intermediate habitats. The strong correlation between phenotype and environment suggests that morphs have fitness advantages in their respective habitats. We speculate that disruptive natural selection on color pattern to increase crypsis in heterogeneous visual environments has led to divergence in habitat preferences. The resulting ecological isolation provides a plausible mechanism for the persistence of multiple coexisting color phenotypes in P. arcatus. If divergence in color also affects mate choice, the evolution of reproductive isolation is likely to be promoted.},

  abstract = {Ecology is often said to lack general theories sufficiently predictive for applications. Here, we examine the concept of a periodic table of niches and feasibility of niche classification schemes from functional trait and performance data. Niche differences and their influence on ecological patterns and processes could be revealed effectively by first performing data reduction/ordination analyses separately on matrices of trait and performance data compiled according to logical associations with five basic niche 'dimensions', or aspects: habitat, life history, trophic, defence and metabolic. Resultant patterns then are integrated to produce interpretable niche gradients, ordinations and classifications. Degree of scheme periodicity would depend on degrees of niche conservatism and convergence causing species clustering across multiple niche dimensions. We analysed a sample data set containing trait and performance data to contrast two approaches for producing niche schemes: species ordination within niche gradient space, and niche categorisation according to trait-value thresholds. Creation of niche schemes useful for advancing ecological knowledge and its applications will depend on research that produces functional trait and performance datasets directly related to niche dimensions along with criteria for data standardisation and quality. As larger databases are compiled, opportunities will emerge to explore new methods for data reduction, ordination and classification. \textcopyright{} 2015 The Authors.
