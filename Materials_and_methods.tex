\subsection{Sampling and specimens}

Fishes were collected during Ifremer's EVHOE (EValuation Halieutique de l'Ouest Européen) research cruises, surveying the Bay of Biscay every fall onboard the \textit{R/V Thalassa}.
Several hauls are regularly performed at night to investiate pelagic deep fauna. Each station is precisely defined with its GPS coordinates and located above canyons, at the the edge of continental shelf. 
% Altough they are considered to be ``biodiversity hotspot'', canyons communities are yet relatively unknown, because of the logistic and material difficulties that their exploration implies \citep{gillet2013}.
Pelagic trawling is performed during night, between 700 and 2000 meters, because those fishes perform diel vertical migrations and tends to come closer to the surface at nighttime. To this end, 25 meters-wide opening trawl is used, with as mesh size decreasing from 76mm to 48mm at the end of the trawl. The trawl-haul duration was 1 hour at 4 kn. 
Once the trawl is pulled back onboard, fishes are sorted, identified, up to species, and frozen at -20°C. Eleven of the most abundant species in the Bay of Biscay have been selected for this study. All teleost, 4 of them belong to the Myctophid family (lanternfish), which is the most abundant and widely spread family across all oceans \citep{debusserolles2014} and could represent up to 65\% of the pelagic deep-sea biomass \citep{poulsen2013}: \textit{Lampanyctus crocodilus}, \textit{Myctophum punctatum}, \textit{Notoscopelus kroeyeri} and \textit{Ceratoscopelus maderensis}. The second most represented family is the Platytrocidae with 2 species: \textit{Searsia koefoedi} \& \textit{Normichthys operosus}. This family seems to be found in all oceans but not in Mediterranean Sea \citep{orrell2016}. Finally, 5 families are represented by one species each: \textit{Xenodermichthys copei} (Alepocephalidae); \textit{Arctozenus risso} (Paralepididae), \textit{Argyropelecus olfersii} (Sternoptychidae), \textit{Serrivomer beanii} (Serrivomeridae) and \textit{Stomias boa} (Stomiidae) which are common species, found abundantly in every ocean \citep{carvalho1988,froese2019,geidner2008,germain2019}. See \ref{fig:phylotree} for phylogenetic tree of studied species. 


\subsection{Morphological measurements and functional traits}
In lab, fish were thaw and 24 morphological measurements were taken on individuals, using an electronic caliper with a precision up to 0.01mm. Part of these measurements had previously been taken by students from La Rochelle University during pratictal class from 2018 (\textit{n=99}), 2019 (\textit{n=45}), 2020 (\textit{n=9}) and the rest during this study (\textit{n=212}). For the sake of statistical robustness and representativity, at least 25 individuals were measured for each species (see Table \ref{table:spcount}).

Following what had been made on similar studies and according to our measurements, a total of 21 functional traits were computed from morphological measurements and informs on 3 main functions: food acquisition, locomotion and habitat (see Table \ref{table:functraits}).

\subsection{Data analysis}
All data analysis were performed using \textsf{R} version 4.0.3 \citet{rcoreteam2021}.

\subsubsection{Data pre-processing}
Because measurements came from several observators, raw data had to be checked for outliers. To do so, all values (except \textsc{sl}) were standardized by \textsc{sl} to get rid and the interquartile range (IQR) method of outlier detection was applied to remove outliers. According to this method, for each variable (measurement) and for each species, outliers are defined as every value outside this interval: 
\begin{center}
$ [Q1 - 1.5*QR, Q3 + 1.5*IQR]$ \\
with $Q1$ and $Q3$ being respectively first and third quartile, $IQR = Q3 - Q1$. 
\end{center}{}


Missing values that were previously presents in the data set (\textit{n=52}) and those induced by outlier removal function (\textit{n=307}), are then imputed following k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) method, which as proven to be effective \citep{zhang2012}. Based on non-missing values points, kNN algorithm computes Euclidian distances between points, and assumes that missing value can be approximated by the values of points that are the closest. To this end \emph{tidymodels} R package and \emph{step\_knnimpute} function \citep{kuhn2020} were used, with a number of nearest neighbors (\textit{k}) of $\sqrt{N}$, with $N$ being the number of observations, i.e individuals, of the dataset. Accuracy was then checked with linear regression of each variable with \textsc{sl}. From this cleaned dataset, functional traits were computed using formulas in Table \ref{table:functraits}. 

\subsubsection{Factorial Analysis of Mixed Data (FAMD)}
To assess similarity or differences in species in terms of traits, FAMD was performed. This type of analysis is suited for dataset containing a mix of qualitative and quantitative variables, and performs PCA (Principal Component Analysis) on quantitative variables and MCA (Multiple Correspondence Analysis) on qualitative variables. In the same way that PCA, FAMD is used to assess similarity/difference of individuals and to check for association between the variables. To this end, \emph{FactoMineR} and especially \emph{FAMD} function were used. Because \textit{Serrivomer beanii} does not have pectoral nor pelvic fins, and because this analysis can not handle missing values, zero values were attributed for \textsc{PFB}, \textsc{PFI}, \textsc{PPL} and \textsc{PVL}.
