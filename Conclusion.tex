Because studies of functional diversity in submarine canyons communities are scarce, comparisons with other systems are limited. Looking at Bay of Biscay's deep-sea fishes, we found that they displayed significant functional diversity, which is consistent with \citet{aneeshkumar2017} and \citet{carrington2021} work. Some of these species being functionaly specialized, they are therefore not competiting, conversely to what might be expected in such a nutrient-poor environment. These results are in agreement with \citet{preciado2017}, who showed that these communities do not seem to display high dietary overlap, indicating a high degree of resources partitioning. Finally, overlap even seems to decrease with depth, because specialization is stronger \citep{carrasson2002,farre2016}.
