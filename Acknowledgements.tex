First of all, I would like to thank my two tutors, Jérôme Spitz and Benoit Simon-Bouhet, for the trust they placed in me and their commitment to me during these five months. I thank them for their expertise, their good advice, their kindness and their good humour. They integrated me and encouraged me throughout the stages of this project. Above all, they always found time for me and were very patient, and I am grateful for that. 

I would also like to thank our second year Master's supervisor, Vincent Le Fouest, for accompanying us during this year. More generally, I thank the entire teaching staff of the GEEL master's programme at the University of La Rochelle for providing us with high quality courses that have contributed to the scientific knowledge we will carry with us in our lives. 

I sincerely thank the whole PELAGIS team, that quickly made us part of the laboratory life. I thank all the others trainees that were present during these few months and the PhD students, who contributed to make this internship a real human experience. 

Finally, I thank Delphine for her careful reading of my report (from which I am still waiting for feedback). Thanks also to Sarah and Alizée, and to the wonderful Copépotes team for the moral support and much more.
